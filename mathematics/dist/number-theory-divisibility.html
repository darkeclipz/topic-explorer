<h1>Number Theory</h1>
<h2>Divisibility</h2>
<p>Divisibility is a fundamental concept in number theory that deals with how one integer can be evenly divided by another integer without leaving a remainder. Here's a detailed explanation of the concept along with related rules and properties:</p>
<h3>Basic Definition</h3>
<p>An integer ( a ) is said to be divisible by another integer ( b ) (where ( b ) is not zero) if there exists an integer ( k ) such that:
[ a = b \times k ]</p>
<p>In this case, we say that ( b ) is a divisor of ( a ) or ( a ) is a multiple of ( b ). We often use the notation ( b \mid a ) to signify that ( b ) divides ( a ).</p>
<h3>Divisibility Rules</h3>
<p>There are specific rules that help determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually performing the division. Here are some common divisibility rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 2:</strong> A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 3:</strong> A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 4:</strong> A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 5:</strong> A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 6:</strong> A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 7:</strong> A common method is to double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number, and if the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 8:</strong> A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 9:</strong> A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divisibility by 10:</strong> A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Properties of Divisibility</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Transitivity:</strong> If ( a \mid b ) and ( b \mid c ), then ( a \mid c ).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Addition and Subtraction:</strong> If ( a \mid b ) and ( a \mid c ), then ( a \mid (b + c) ) and ( a \mid (b - c) ).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> If ( a \mid b ), then ( a \mid (b \times k) ) for any integer ( k ).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GCD and LCM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):</strong> The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both.</li>
<li><strong>Least Common Multiple (LCM):</strong> The LCM of two integers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Determine if 124 is divisible by 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>The last two digits of 124 are 24.</li>
<li>Since 24 is divisible by 4, 124 is also divisible by 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Determine if 135 is divisible by 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sum of the digits: ( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 ).</li>
<li>Since 9 is divisible by 3, 135 is also divisible by 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Understanding divisibility is essential for various areas of number theory and for simplifying problems involving integers. Mastery of divisibility rules and their properties can significantly enhance problem-solving skills, especially in mathematical proofs and integer factorization.</p>
