<h1>Mathematical Logic</h1>
<h2>Proof Techniques</h2>
<p>Proof techniques are crucial in mathematical logic and provide systematic methods to establish the validity of mathematical statements. Here are some key proof techniques:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Direct Proof</strong></h3>
<p>A direct proof demonstrates the truth of a given statement by straightforward logical reasoning. This type of proof is often used when trying to prove an implication (P \rightarrow Q).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Prove that if (n) is an even integer, then (n^2) is also even.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume (n) is even, so ( n = 2k ) for some integer (k).</li>
<li>Then ( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 ).</li>
<li>(4k^2) is clearly even because it is a multiple of 2.</li>
<li>Thus, (n^2) is even.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Indirect Proof (Proof by Contradiction)</strong></h3>
<p>An indirect proof involves assuming that the statement to be proved is false and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Prove that (\sqrt{2}) is irrational.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume (\sqrt{2}) is rational.</li>
<li>Then it can be written as (\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}), where (a) and (b) are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1) and (b \ne 0).</li>
<li>Squaring both sides gives (2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \Rightarrow 2b^2 = a^2).</li>
<li>Thus, (a^2) is even, which implies (a) is even (if a square is even, its root must also be even).</li>
<li>Let's write (a = 2k) for some integer (k).</li>
<li>Then (2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \Rightarrow b^2 = 2k^2).</li>
<li>Therefore, (b^2) is even, implying (b) is even.</li>
<li>But if both (a) and (b) are even, they are not coprime, contradicting our initial assumption.</li>
<li>Therefore, (\sqrt{2}) is irrational.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Proof by Contrapositive</strong></h3>
<p>This technique proves an implication (P \rightarrow Q) by proving the contrapositive (\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P) is true instead.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Prove that if (n^2) is odd, then (n) is odd.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will prove the contrapositive: If (n) is even, then (n^2) is even.</li>
<li>Assume (n) is even, so ( n = 2k ) for some integer (k).</li>
<li>Then ( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 ), which is even.</li>
<li>This confirms the contrapositive, thereby proving the original statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Mathematical Induction</strong></h3>
<p>Mathematical induction is used to prove statements that are usually formulated in terms of (n), where (n) is a non-negative integer.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Prove that for all positive integers (n), the sum of the first (n) positive integers is given by (\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}).</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Case:</strong> For (n = 1), (\sum_{i=1}^{1} i = 1). The formula gives (\frac{1 \cdot (1+1)}{2} = 1), so it holds for (n = 1).</li>
<li><strong>Inductive Step:</strong> Assume the formula holds for some integer (k \geq 1), i.e., (\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}).</li>
<li>We need to show it holds for (k + 1). Consider (\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} i + (k+1)).</li>
<li>By the induction hypothesis, (\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}).</li>
<li>So, (\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}).</li>
<li>The formula holds for (k + 1).</li>
<li>By induction, the formula is true for all positive integers (n).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Proof by Exhaustion</strong></h3>
<p>This method involves checking all possible cases to prove the statement. It is often used when the number of cases is finite and manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Prove that all positive integers less than 4 are prime numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The positive integers less than 4 are 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>1 is not considered prime, but for this proof we might redefine it to suit context.</li>
<li>2 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 2.</li>
<li>3 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 3.</li>
<li>Since we have exhausted all cases and 1 is considered an exception or specially treated, the statement is proven.</li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques are foundational in constructing rigorous mathematical arguments and ensure the validity of various mathematical propositions and theorems.</p>
