<h2>Quadratic Equations</h2>
<p>A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable ( x ), with the general form:</p>
<p>[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ]</p>
<p>where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants, and ( a \neq 0 ) (if ( a = 0 ), the equation would be linear, not quadratic).</p>
<h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Standard Form</strong>:
The standard form of a quadratic equation is ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Solutions</strong>:
The solutions to the quadratic equation are the values of ( x ) that satisfy the equation. These are called the roots of the equation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Factoring</strong>:
Some quadratic equations can be factored into the form:
[
(px + q)(rx + s) = 0
]
The solutions are found by setting each factor equal to zero:
[
px + q = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad rx + s = 0
]</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Quadratic Formula</strong>:
For any quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:
[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
]
Here, ( \pm ) indicates that there are generally two solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Discriminant</strong>:
The expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, ( b^2 - 4ac ), is called the discriminant and is denoted by ( \Delta ). It indicates the nature of the roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ( \Delta &gt; 0 ): There are two distinct real roots.</li>
<li>If ( \Delta = 0 ): There is exactly one real root (repeated root).</li>
<li>If ( \Delta &lt; 0 ): There are no real roots (the roots are complex numbers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Completing the Square</strong>:
This method involves rewriting the quadratic equation in the form:
[
(x - h)^2 = k
]
It is useful for understanding the derivation of the quadratic formula and for converting the equation into a form that reveals the vertex of the parabola.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Consider the quadratic equation:</p>
<p>[ 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 ]</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using the Quadratic Formula</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -4 ), ( c = -6 ).</li>
<li>Discriminant, ( \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6) = 16 + 48 = 64 ).</li>
<li>Since ( \Delta = 64 ), which is greater than 0, there are two distinct real roots.</li>
<li>Applying the quadratic formula:
[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2(2)} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
]
[
x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = -1
]</li>
<li>Therefore, the solutions are ( x = 3 ) and ( x = -1 ).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding quadratic equations not only equips one to solve a variety of mathematical problems but also provides a foundation for many topics in higher mathematics.</p>
