<h1>Calculus</h1>
<h2>Integrals</h2>
<p>Integrals are a fundamental concept in calculus, often used in various branches of mathematics, physics, engineering, and other sciences. Integrals are broadly classified into definite and indefinite integrals. Here’s an overview of each:</p>
<h3>Indefinite Integrals</h3>
<p><strong>Indefinite integral</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The indefinite integral of a function represents a family of functions whose derivative is the given function.</li>
<li>It is essentially the reverse process of differentiation.</li>
<li>The notation for an indefinite integral is ∫f(x)dx, which is read as &quot;the integral of f of x with respect to x.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If f(x) = 2x, an indefinite integral of 2x with respect to x is ∫2x dx = x² + C, where C is the constant of integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Integration rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Rule</strong>: ∫a dx = ax + C</li>
<li><strong>Power Rule</strong>: ∫xn dx = (xn+1)/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1)</li>
<li><strong>Sum Rule</strong>: ∫[f(x) + g(x)] dx = ∫f(x) dx + ∫g(x) dx</li>
<li><strong>Difference Rule</strong>: ∫[f(x) - g(x)] dx = ∫f(x) dx - ∫g(x) dx</li>
<li><strong>Substitution Rule</strong>: Used when integrating composite functions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Definite Integrals</h3>
<p><strong>Definite integral</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definite integral of a function over an interval [a, b] gives the net area under the curve of the function from x = a to x = b.</li>
<li>It is represented by ∫[a, b] f(x) dx, where a and b are the limits of integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to find the area under the curve of f(x) = x² from x = 1 to x = 3, you calculate ∫[1, 3] x² dx.</p>
<p>∫[1, 3] x² dx = [x³/3] from 1 to 3
= [(3³/3) - (1³/3)]
= (27/3) - (1/3)
= 9 - 1/3
= 8.67</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h3>
<p>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links the concept of differentiation and integration in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If F is an antiderivative of f on an interval [a, b], then:
∫[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If f is continuous on [a, b] and F is defined by F(x) = ∫[a, x] f(t) dt, then F is differentiable, and F'(x) = f(x).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Applications of Integrals</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Area under a curve</strong>: Calculating the area between the x-axis and the curve of a function.</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Determining the volume of solids of revolution using methods such as the disk, washer, and shell methods.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Computing the work done when a force is applied over a distance.</li>
<li><strong>Center of mass</strong>: Finding the center of mass of a system with continuous mass distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Probability</strong>: In statistics, the integral of a probability density function over an interval represents the probability of the variable falling within that interval.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding integrals requires practice and familiarity with various techniques and rules of integration, but they are a powerful tool in solving many real-world problems.</p>
