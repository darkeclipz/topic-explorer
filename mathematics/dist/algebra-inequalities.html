<h1>Algebra</h1>
<h2>Inequalities</h2>
<p>Inequalities are an essential concept in algebra that extend the idea of equations to express a range of possible values rather than a specific value. Here's an overview of key points related to inequalities:</p>
<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: Inequalities compare two expressions using inequality symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code> (greater than)</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code> (less than)</li>
<li><code>≥</code> (greater than or equal to)</li>
<li><code>≤</code> (less than or equal to)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Notation</strong>: If (a) and (b) are real numbers, inequalities can be written in various forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a &gt; b) (a is greater than b)</li>
<li>(a &lt; b) (a is less than b)</li>
<li>(a \geq b) (a is greater than or equal to b)</li>
<li>(a \leq b) (a is less than or equal to b)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solving Inequalities</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Isolating the Variable</strong>: Similar to solving equations, you isolate the variable on one side of the inequality by performing arithmetic operations. For example:
[
2x + 3 &gt; 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x &gt; 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x &gt; 2
]</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changing Direction</strong>: When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality changes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ( -2x &gt; 6 ), divide both sides by -2 to get ( x &lt; -3 ).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compound Inequalities</strong>: Sometimes, you deal with compound inequalities involving logical &quot;and&quot; (intersection) and &quot;or&quot; (union):</p>
<ul>
<li>(1 &lt; x &lt; 5) is read as (x) is greater than 1 and less than 5.</li>
<li>(x &lt; -1 \text{ or } x &gt; 3) represents two separate intervals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Graphical Representation</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Number Line</strong>: Solutions to inequalities can be represented on a number line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open circle ((\circ)) indicates the number is not included (for (&gt;) or (&lt;)).</li>
<li>Closed circle ((\bullet)) indicates the number is included (for (≥) or (≤)).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Shading</strong>: The area on the number line that satisfies the inequality is shaded. For (x &gt; 2), you shade that part of the number line greater than 2, with an open circle at 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Systems of Inequalities</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphical Method</strong>: Systems of inequalities can be solved by graphing them on coordinate planes. The solution is the region where the shaded areas overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Algebraic Method</strong>: Systems can also be solved algebraically by finding common solutions that satisfy all inequalities in the system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: Inequalities are used in optimization problems where you want to maximize or minimize a function subject to constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility Regions</strong>: In linear programming, inequalities define the feasible region where the possible solutions to a problem lie.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example Problem</h3>
<p>Solve the inequality and represent the solution on a number line:
[ 3x - 5 \leq 7 ]</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate (x):
[
3x - 5 \leq 7
]
[
3x \leq 12 \quad (\text{Add 5 to both sides})
]
[
x \leq 4 \quad (\text{Divide both sides by 3})
]</li>
<li>Representation on a number line:
<ul>
<li>A closed circle at 4 (since (x) is less than or equal to 4).</li>
<li>Shade the region to the left of 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding and manipulating inequalities, you can solve a wide range of mathematical and real-world problems.</p>
