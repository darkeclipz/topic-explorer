<h1>Number Theory</h1>
<h2>Number Patterns</h2>
<p>Number patterns, a key concept within Number Theory, refer to the sequences and structures that emerge from the arrangement and properties of numbers. These patterns often reveal significant insights about the numbers themselves and can be used to solve problems or establish mathematical principles. Here are some important types of number patterns and their characteristics:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Arithmetic Sequences</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ... (Here, the common difference is 3)</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> The ( n )-th term ( a_n ) can be expressed as ( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d ), where ( a_1 ) is the first term and ( d ) is the common difference.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Geometric Sequences</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 3, 9, 27, 81, ... (Here, the common ratio is 3)</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> The ( n )-th term ( a_n ) can be expressed as ( a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)} ), where ( a_1 ) is the first term and ( r ) is the common ratio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> ( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} ) with initial conditions ( F_0 = 0 ) and ( F_1 = 1 ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Triangular Numbers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The ( n )-th triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with ( n ) dots on a side.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> The ( n )-th triangular number ( T_n ) is ( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Square Numbers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Numbers that are the square of an integer.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> The ( n )-th square number is ( n^2 ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Pentagonal Numbers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Numbers that can form a pentagon. The ( n )-th pentagonal number is given by a specific formula.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</li>
<li><strong>Formula:</strong> The ( n )-th pentagonal number ( P_n ) is ( P_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2} ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Prime Numbers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> There is no simple formula for generating all prime numbers, but they follow an interesting distribution and have applications in cryptography and number theory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. <strong>Perfect Numbers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> 6 (1 + 2 + 3), 28 (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14), ...</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Perfect numbers are rare and there is a deep connection with Mersenne primes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. <strong>Harmonic Sequence</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A sequence of the form ( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, ... )</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Though the terms get closer to zero, the sum of the series diverges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. <strong>Pascalâ€™s Triangle</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> An infinite triangular array of the binomial coefficients.</li>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each number is the sum of the two directly above it.</li>
<li><strong>Patterns:</strong> Contains many number patterns, including triangular numbers, Fibonacci sequence, and binomial expansions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding number patterns helps in recognizing the inherent beauty of mathematics and its applications. These patterns can often lead to the discovery of new mathematical principles, algorithms, and solutions to complex problems.</p>
