<h2>Linear Equations</h2>
<p>Linear equations are a foundational concept in algebra, and they represent equations in which the highest power of the variable(s) is one. These equations are used to model and solve a wide range of problems in mathematics and real-world scenarios.</p>
<h3>Key Concepts of Linear Equations</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Definition:</strong>
A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form:
[
ax + b = 0
]
where (a) and (b) are constants, and (x) is the variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Standard Form:</strong>
The standard form of a linear equation in two variables is:
[
Ax + By = C
]
where (A), (B), and (C) are constants, and (x) and (y) are variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Slope-Intercept Form:</strong>
A common way to express a linear equation is the slope-intercept form:
[
y = mx + b
]
where (m) is the slope of the line, and (b) is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Graphing Linear Equations:</strong>
Linear equations in two variables can be graphed on a Cartesian plane. The graph is a straight line, and you can plot it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the (y)-intercept ((b)).</li>
<li>Using the slope ((m)) to determine the rise over run from the (y)-intercept.</li>
<li>Plotting additional points and drawing the line through them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Solving Linear Equations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Variable:</strong>
To solve (ax + b = 0), isolate (x):
[
x = -\frac{b}{a}
]</li>
<li><strong>Two Variables (System of Linear Equations):</strong>
Methods to solve systems include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Substitution:</strong> Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.</li>
<li><strong>Elimination:</strong> Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable.</li>
<li><strong>Graphing:</strong> Graph both equations and find the intersection point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word Problems:</strong>
Linear equations are often used to solve real-world problems involving relationships between quantities. Set up the equation based on the problem, solve for the unknown, and interpret the result.</li>
<li><strong>Economics:</strong> Modeling supply and demand, cost and revenue functions.</li>
<li><strong>Physics:</strong> Describing motion at constant speed, Hookeâ€™s law for springs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example Problem:</h3>
<p><strong>Problem: Solve the linear equation (2x + 5 = 11).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the equation:
[
2x + 5 = 11
]</li>
<li>Subtract 5 from both sides:
[
2x = 6
]</li>
<li>Divide both sides by 2:
[
x = 3
]</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Problem: Solve the system of equations:</strong>
[
\begin{cases}
x + 2y = 4 \
3x - y = 5
\end{cases}
]</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Solve the first equation for (x):
[
x = 4 - 2y
]</li>
<li>Substitute (x = 4 - 2y) into the second equation:
[
3(4 - 2y) - y = 5
]</li>
<li>Simplify and solve for (y):
[
12 - 6y - y = 5 \
12 - 7y = 5 \
-7y = -7 \
y = 1
]</li>
<li>Substitute (y = 1) back into (x = 4 - 2y):
[
x = 4 - 2(1) \
x = 2
]</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (x = 2) and (y = 1).</p>
<p>Linear equations are a crucial tool in algebra and serve as the foundation for understanding more complex mathematical concepts. They are also highly applicable in various fields such as science, engineering, economics, and social sciences.</p>
