<h1>Geometry</h1>
<h2>Triangles</h2>
<p>Sure! Triangles are a fundamental shape in geometry, and they have many interesting properties and classifications. Here are some key aspects of triangles:</p>
<h3>Basic Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Triangle</strong>: A polygon with three sides, three vertices, and three angles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Classifications of Triangles</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Based on Side Lengths</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equilateral Triangle</strong>: All three sides are of equal length, and all three interior angles are 60 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>Isosceles Triangle</strong>: At least two sides are of equal length. The angles opposite these sides are also equal.</li>
<li><strong>Scalene Triangle</strong>: All three sides and all three angles are of different measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Based on Angles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acute Triangle</strong>: All three interior angles are less than 90 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>Right Triangle</strong>: One of the interior angles is exactly 90 degrees. The side opposite this angle is known as the hypotenuse.</li>
<li><strong>Obtuse Triangle</strong>: One of the interior angles is greater than 90 degrees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Properties of Triangles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sum of Interior Angles</strong>: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>Exterior Angle Theorem</strong>: The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.</li>
<li><strong>Triangle Inequality Theorem</strong>: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Segments in Triangles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Altitude</strong>: A perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.</li>
<li><strong>Median</strong>: A segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.</li>
<li><strong>Angle Bisector</strong>: A segment that bisects one of the angles of the triangle, dividing it into two equal angles.</li>
<li><strong>Perpendicular Bisector</strong>: A line that is perpendicular to a side of the triangle at its midpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Triangle Centers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centroid</strong>: The point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. It is the center of mass and is located two-thirds of the distance from each vertex along the median.</li>
<li><strong>Orthocenter</strong>: The point where the three altitudes of the triangle intersect.</li>
<li><strong>Circumcenter</strong>: The point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect. It is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle.</li>
<li><strong>Incenter</strong>: The point where the angle bisectors intersect. It is the center of the inscribed circle within the triangle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Triangle Theorems</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pythagorean Theorem</strong>: In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ((c)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ((a) and (b)): (a^2 + b^2 = c^2).</li>
<li><strong>Sine Rule</strong>: (\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}), where (a), (b), and (c) are the lengths of the sides opposite the angles (A), (B), and (C), respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Cosine Rule</strong>: (c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C), which generalizes the Pythagorean theorem for any triangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Triangles form the basis for many geometric concepts and applications, making them a crucial area of study in geometry.</p>
