<h1>Geometry</h1>
<h2>Congruence and Similarity</h2>
<p>Congruence and similarity are fundamental concepts in geometry that involve comparing the properties and measurements of geometric figures. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:</p>
<h3>Congruence:</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two geometric figures are congruent if they have the same shape and size. This means that one can be transformed into the other using a series of rigid motions—such as translation (sliding), rotation (turning), and reflection (flipping).</p>
<p><strong>Properties of Congruent Figures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equal Corresponding Angles:</strong> Each pair of corresponding angles in the two figures is equal.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Corresponding Sides:</strong> Each pair of corresponding sides in the two figures has the same length.</li>
<li><strong>Notation:</strong> Congruent figures are denoted using the congruence symbol (≅). For example, if triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, it is written as △ABC ≅ △DEF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Congruence Criteria for Triangles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence:</strong> If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.</li>
<li><strong>Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence:</strong> If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.</li>
<li><strong>Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence:</strong> If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.</li>
<li><strong>Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence:</strong> If two angles and a corresponding non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and a corresponding non-included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.</li>
<li><strong>Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Congruence (for right triangles):</strong> If the hypotenuse and one leg of one right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one leg of another right triangle, the triangles are congruent.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Similarity:</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two geometric figures are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Similar figures can be obtained from one another by scaling (resizing) in addition to rigid motions.</p>
<p><strong>Properties of Similar Figures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equal Corresponding Angles:</strong> Each pair of corresponding angles in the two figures is equal.</li>
<li><strong>Proportional Corresponding Sides:</strong> The lengths of corresponding sides are in proportion (i.e., the ratios of the lengths of corresponding sides are equal).</li>
<li><strong>Notation:</strong> Similar figures are denoted using the similarity symbol (~). For example, if triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF, it is written as △ABC ~ △DEF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Similarity Criteria for Triangles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Angle-Angle (AA) Similarity:</strong> If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar.</li>
<li><strong>Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity:</strong> If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the lengths of the sides including these angles are proportional, the triangles are similar.</li>
<li><strong>Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity:</strong> If the lengths of corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, the triangles are similar.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Applications:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Congruence:</strong> Useful in determining exact equality and symmetry. It's commonly used in proofs and constructions in geometry.</li>
<li><strong>Similarity:</strong> Used in solving problems involving scale drawings, models, maps, and any situation where a proportional relationship is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving a wide range of geometric problems and proving various geometric properties and theorems.</p>
