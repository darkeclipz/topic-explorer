# Geometry
## Polygons

Polygons are fundamental shapes in geometry defined by having multiple straight sides. Here’s a detailed breakdown of key concepts related to polygons:

### Definition:
A polygon is a two-dimensional closed figure with straight sides. Each side intersects exactly two other sides at their endpoints, creating vertices.

### Classification:
1. **Based on the Number of Sides:**
    - **Triangle:** 3 sides
    - **Quadrilateral:** 4 sides
    - **Pentagon:** 5 sides
    - **Hexagon:** 6 sides
    - **Heptagon:** 7 sides
    - **Octagon:** 8 sides (and so forth)

2. **Regular vs. Irregular Polygons:**
    - **Regular Polygon:** All sides and internal angles are equal (e.g., equilateral triangle, square).
    - **Irregular Polygon:** Sides and/or internal angles are not equal.

3. **Convex vs. Concave Polygons:**
    - **Convex Polygon:** All interior angles are less than 180°, and no side extends into the interior.
    - **Concave Polygon:** At least one interior angle is greater than 180°, and at least one side extends into the interior.

### Properties:
1. **Sum of Interior Angles:**
    The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Sum of Interior Angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
    \]
    For example, for a hexagon (\( n = 6 \)):
    \[
    \text{Sum of Interior Angles} = (6 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
    \]

2. **Number of Diagonals:**
    The number of diagonals (\( D \)) in a polygon with \( n \) sides can be calculated using:
    \[
    D = \frac{n(n - 3)}{2}
    \]
    For instance, a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)) has:
    \[
    D = \frac{5(5 - 3)}{2} = 5
    \]

3. **Exterior Angles:**
    The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \( 360^\circ \) regardless of the number of sides.

### Area Calculation:
1. **Regular Polygons:**
    For regular polygons, the area \( A \) can often be computed if the length of a side \( s \) and the number of sides \( n \) are known. The formula for the area of a regular polygon is:
    \[
    A = \frac{n \cdot s^2}{4 \cdot \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)}
    \]

2. **Triangles:**
    \[
    A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}
    \]

3. **Quadrilaterals (like rectangles and squares):**
    \[
    A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
    \]

### Special Polygons:
1. **Triangles:**
    - Types: Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene
    - Properties: The sum of internal angles is always \( 180^\circ \).

2. **Quadrilaterals:**
    - Types: Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Parallelogram, Trapezoid
    - Properties: The sum of internal angles is always \( 360^\circ \).

### Applications:
Polygons are used in various fields such as:
- **Architecture and Engineering:** For designing structures and materials.
- **Computer Graphics:** Modeling complex shapes and structures.
- **Geography:** Defining boundaries and plotting maps.
- **Robotics:** Navigation and pathfinding algorithms.

Understanding polygons lays the foundation for more advanced geometric concepts and their applications in real life.
