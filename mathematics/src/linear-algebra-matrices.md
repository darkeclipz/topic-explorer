# Linear Algebra
## Matrices

Matrices are a fundamental concept in linear algebra, a branch of mathematics focused on vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Here are some key aspects of matrices:

### Definitions
- **Element**: Each individual number or expression within a matrix.
- **Order**: Describes the dimensions of the matrix, given in the format \( m \times n \) where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns.
- **Square Matrix**: A matrix with the same number of rows and columns ( \( m = n \) ).
- **Row Matrix**: A matrix with a single row ( \( 1 \times n \) ).
- **Column Matrix**: A matrix with a single column ( \( m \times 1 \) ).
- **Zero Matrix**: A matrix in which all elements are zero.
- **Identity Matrix**: A square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

### Basic Operations
- **Addition**: Two matrices of the same order can be added by adding their corresponding elements.
  
  Example:
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4
  \end{pmatrix}, \,
  B = \begin{pmatrix}
  5 & 6 \\
  7 & 8
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  \[
  A + B = \begin{pmatrix}
  1+5 & 2+6 \\
  3+7 & 4+8
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  6 & 8 \\
  10 & 12
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **Subtraction**: Performed similarly to addition but involves subtracting the corresponding elements.

- **Scalar Multiplication**: Each element of the matrix is multiplied by a scalar (a single number).

  Example:
  \[
  k = 2, \,
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  \[
  kA = 2 \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  2 & 4 \\
  6 & 8
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **Matrix Multiplication**: The element in the i-th row and j-th column of the product matrix is computed by taking the dot product of the i-th row of the first matrix and the j-th column of the second matrix.

  Example:
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4
  \end{pmatrix}, \,
  B = \begin{pmatrix}
  2 & 0 \\
  1 & 3
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  \[
  AB = \begin{pmatrix}
  (1*2 + 2*1) & (1*0 + 2*3) \\
  (3*2 + 4*1) & (3*0 + 4*3)
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  4 & 6 \\
  10 & 12
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **Transpose**: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with its columns.

  Example:
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  \[
  A^T = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 3 \\
  2 & 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

### Determinant and Inverse
- **Determinant**: A scalar value that can determine whether a matrix is invertible. For a 2x2 matrix:

  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  \[
  \text{det}(A) = ad - bc
  \]

- **Inverse**: If a matrix \( A \) is invertible, there exists a matrix \( A^{-1} \) such that \( AA^{-1} = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:

  \[
  A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \begin{pmatrix}
  d & -b \\
  -c & a
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

### Applications
Matrices are widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, computer graphics, economics, and statistics. They are essential for solving systems of linear equations, representing linear transformations, and performing data manipulations.

Understanding matrices and their operations is crucial for any advanced study in mathematics and fields that rely heavily on mathematical concepts.
