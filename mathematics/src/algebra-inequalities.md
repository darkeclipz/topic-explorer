## Inequalities

Inequalities are an essential concept in algebra that extend the idea of equations to express a range of possible values rather than a specific value. Here's an overview of key points related to inequalities:

### Basic Concepts

1. **Definition**: Inequalities compare two expressions using inequality symbols:
   - `>` (greater than)
   - `<` (less than)
   - `≥` (greater than or equal to)
   - `≤` (less than or equal to)

2. **Notation**: If \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, inequalities can be written in various forms:
   - \(a > b\) (a is greater than b)
   - \(a < b\) (a is less than b)
   - \(a \geq b\) (a is greater than or equal to b)
   - \(a \leq b\) (a is less than or equal to b)

### Solving Inequalities

1. **Isolating the Variable**: Similar to solving equations, you isolate the variable on one side of the inequality by performing arithmetic operations. For example:
   \[
   2x + 3 > 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x > 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x > 2
   \]

2. **Changing Direction**: When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality changes. For example:
   - If \( -2x > 6 \), divide both sides by -2 to get \( x < -3 \).

3. **Compound Inequalities**: Sometimes, you deal with compound inequalities involving logical "and" (intersection) and "or" (union):
   - \(1 < x < 5\) is read as \(x\) is greater than 1 and less than 5.
   - \(x < -1 \text{ or } x > 3\) represents two separate intervals.

### Graphical Representation

1. **Number Line**: Solutions to inequalities can be represented on a number line:
   - Open circle \((\circ)\) indicates the number is not included (for \(>\) or \(<\)).
   - Closed circle \((\bullet)\) indicates the number is included (for \(≥\) or \(≤\)).

2. **Shading**: The area on the number line that satisfies the inequality is shaded. For \(x > 2\), you shade that part of the number line greater than 2, with an open circle at 2.

### Systems of Inequalities

1. **Graphical Method**: Systems of inequalities can be solved by graphing them on coordinate planes. The solution is the region where the shaded areas overlap.
2. **Algebraic Method**: Systems can also be solved algebraically by finding common solutions that satisfy all inequalities in the system.

### Applications

1. **Optimization**: Inequalities are used in optimization problems where you want to maximize or minimize a function subject to constraints.
2. **Feasibility Regions**: In linear programming, inequalities define the feasible region where the possible solutions to a problem lie.

### Example Problem

Solve the inequality and represent the solution on a number line:
\[ 3x - 5 \leq 7 \]

**Solution**:
1. Isolate \(x\):
   \[
   3x - 5 \leq 7
   \]
   \[
   3x \leq 12 \quad (\text{Add 5 to both sides})
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4 \quad (\text{Divide both sides by 3})
   \]
2. Representation on a number line:
   - A closed circle at 4 (since \(x\) is less than or equal to 4).
   - Shade the region to the left of 4.

By understanding and manipulating inequalities, you can solve a wide range of mathematical and real-world problems.
