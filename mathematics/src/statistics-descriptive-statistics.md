## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive Statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on summarizing and describing the features of a data set. Unlike inferential statistics, which aims to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample, descriptive statistics deals with the presentation of raw data in a punctual and meaningful way. The main goal is to provide a clear and concise summary of a data set's main characteristics.

Here are some key concepts and tools used in descriptive statistics:

### Measures of Central Tendency
These measures indicate the center point or typical value of a data set. The most common measures include:
1. **Mean (Average)**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
   \]
   where \(x_i\) represents individual data points and \(n\) is the number of data points.

2. **Median**: 
   The middle value of a data set when it is ordered from lowest to highest. For an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.

3. **Mode**: 
   The most frequently occurring value(s) in a data set. A data set may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all if no number repeats.

### Measures of Dispersion
These measures provide insights into the spread or variability of the data. Key measures include:
1. **Range**:
   The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.
   \[
   \text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum}
   \]

2. **Variance**: 
   The average of the squared differences from the mean.
   \[
   \text{Variance} (\sigma^2) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}
   \]
   where \(\mu\) is the mean of the data set.

3. **Standard Deviation**: 
   The square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance from the mean.
   \[
   \text{Standard Deviation} (\sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}
   \]

4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
   The difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It represents the range within which the central 50% of the data lies.
   \[
   \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
   \]

### Frequency Distribution
A summary of how often different values occur within a data set. This can be represented using:
1. **Tables**: Listing each value (or range of values) and its corresponding frequency.
2. **Graphs/Charts**: Visual representations like histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to quickly convey the frequency of data.

### Shape of Distribution
Understanding the shape can give insights into the nature of the data set.
1. **Skewness**: Indicates the asymmetry of the distribution.
   - **Positive Skewness**: Tail on the right side is longer or fatter.
   - **Negative Skewness**: Tail on the left side is longer or fatter.

2. **Kurtosis**: Indicates the "tailedness" of the distribution.
   - **High Kurtosis**: Has heavy tails and a sharp peak.
   - **Low Kurtosis**: Has light tails and a flatter peak.

### Summary Statistics
These include both central tendency and dispersion measures to provide a comprehensive overview of the data set.

In summary, descriptive statistics form the foundation for making sense of raw data, enabling researchers and analysts to present their data in a meaningful and accessible way.
