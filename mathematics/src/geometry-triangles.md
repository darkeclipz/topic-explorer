# Geometry
## Triangles

Sure! Triangles are a fundamental shape in geometry, and they have many interesting properties and classifications. Here are some key aspects of triangles:

### Basic Definition
- **Triangle**: A polygon with three sides, three vertices, and three angles.

### Classifications of Triangles
1. **Based on Side Lengths**:
   - **Equilateral Triangle**: All three sides are of equal length, and all three interior angles are 60 degrees.
   - **Isosceles Triangle**: At least two sides are of equal length. The angles opposite these sides are also equal.
   - **Scalene Triangle**: All three sides and all three angles are of different measures.

2. **Based on Angles**:
   - **Acute Triangle**: All three interior angles are less than 90 degrees.
   - **Right Triangle**: One of the interior angles is exactly 90 degrees. The side opposite this angle is known as the hypotenuse.
   - **Obtuse Triangle**: One of the interior angles is greater than 90 degrees.

### Properties of Triangles
- **Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
- **Exterior Angle Theorem**: The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

### Special Segments in Triangles
- **Altitude**: A perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.
- **Median**: A segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
- **Angle Bisector**: A segment that bisects one of the angles of the triangle, dividing it into two equal angles.
- **Perpendicular Bisector**: A line that is perpendicular to a side of the triangle at its midpoint.

### Triangle Centers
- **Centroid**: The point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. It is the center of mass and is located two-thirds of the distance from each vertex along the median.
- **Orthocenter**: The point where the three altitudes of the triangle intersect.
- **Circumcenter**: The point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect. It is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle.
- **Incenter**: The point where the angle bisectors intersect. It is the center of the inscribed circle within the triangle.

### Special Triangle Theorems
- **Pythagorean Theorem**: In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)): \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
- **Sine Rule**: \(\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the lengths of the sides opposite the angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), respectively.
- **Cosine Rule**: \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C\), which generalizes the Pythagorean theorem for any triangle.

Triangles form the basis for many geometric concepts and applications, making them a crucial area of study in geometry.
