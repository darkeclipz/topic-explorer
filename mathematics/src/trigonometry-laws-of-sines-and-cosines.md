## Laws of Sines and Cosines

Certainly! The Laws of Sines and Cosines are fundamental tools in trigonometry, particularly for solving problems involving triangles. They are useful for finding unknown sides and angles in any triangle, not just right-angled triangles.

### Law of Sines

The Law of Sines relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of its angles. It states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides and angles of the triangle.

For a triangle ABC, with sides a, b, and c opposite angles A, B, and C respectively, the Law of Sines is given by:

\[ \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} \]

#### Application:

- **Solving for unknown sides or angles**: If you know two angles and one side, you can use the Law of Sines to find the other sides.
- **Situations involving non-right-angled triangles**: It is particularly useful when dealing with oblique triangles (triangles without a right angle).

### Law of Cosines

The Law of Cosines is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem that works for any triangle, not just right-angled ones. It relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.

For triangle ABC, with sides a, b, and c opposite angles A, B, and C respectively, the Law of Cosines is given by:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C) \]

Similarly, you can write the equations for the other sides:

\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \cos(A) \]

\[ b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cdot \cos(B) \]

#### Application:

- **Solving for unknown sides or angles**: If you know two sides and the included angle, you can use the Law of Cosines to find the third side.
- **Determining angles**: If you know all three sides, you can rearrange the formula to solve for any angle.

### Examples

#### Example using the Law of Sines:

Consider triangle ABC with angles A = 30°, B = 45°, and side a = 10 units.

1. First, find angle C using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°:
   \[ C = 180° - A - B = 180° - 30° - 45° = 105° \]

2. Use the Law of Sines to find side b:
   \[ \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} \]
   \[ \frac{10}{\sin 30°} = \frac{b}{\sin 45°} \]
   \[ \frac{10}{0.5} = \frac{b}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \]
   \[ 20 = \frac{b\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
   \[ b = 20\sqrt{2}/2 = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \text{ units} \]

#### Example using the Law of Cosines:

Consider triangle ABC with sides a = 7 units, b = 10 units, and angle C = 45°.

1. Use the Law of Cosines to find side c:
   \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C) \]
   \[ c^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 10 \cdot \cos(45°) \]
   \[ c^2 = 49 + 100 - 140 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
   \[ c^2 = 149 - 70\sqrt{2} \]
   \[ c \approx \sqrt{149 - 70\sqrt{2}} \approx 8.59 \text{ units} \]

With these laws, you can solve many types of problems involving triangles in trigonometry.
