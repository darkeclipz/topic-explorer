# Geometry
## Coordinate Geometry

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry or Cartesian geometry, is a branch of geometry that uses a coordinate system to investigate the geometric properties of figures and the relationships between them. Here are some of the key concepts and topics within coordinate geometry:

### 1. Coordinate System:
- **Cartesian Coordinate System:** Utilizes two perpendicular axes, typically labeled the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical), to define a plane. Points are represented by ordered pairs (x, y).
- **Polar Coordinate System:** Uses a radius and angle (r, Î¸) from a fixed point known as the pole (origin) to define a point in the plane.

### 2. Points and Distances:
- **Plotting Points:** Points are plotted on the plane based on their coordinates.
- **Distance Formula:** The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

### 3. Midpoint Formula:
- The midpoint of a line segment joining points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
  \[ \text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \]

### 4. Slope and Equations of Lines:
- **Slope:** The slope (m) of a line passing through points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
  \[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
- **Slope-Intercept Form:** The equation of a line with slope \(m\) and y-intercept \(b\) is:
  \[ y = mx + b \]
- **Point-Slope Form:** The equation of a line with slope \(m\) passing through the point \((x_1, y_1)\) is:
  \[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]
- **Standard Form:** The general linear equation \(Ax + By = C\), where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants.

### 5. Circles:
- **Equation of a Circle:** A circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\) is represented by:
  \[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

### 6. Parabolas: 
- **Equation:** The standard form of a parabola with vertex at \((h, k)\) and directrix \(y = k - p\) is:
  \[ (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k) \]

### 7. Ellipses and Hyperbolas:
- **Ellipses:** The equation of an ellipse with center \((h, k)\) and semi-major and semi-minor axes \(a\) and \(b\) is:
  \[ \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \]
- **Hyperbolas:** The equation of a hyperbola with center \((h, k)\) is:
  \[ \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

### 8. Transformations:
- **Translations:** Shifting a graph horizontally or vertically.
- **Rotations:** Rotating a graph around a point.
- **Reflections:** Reflecting a graph across a line, such as the x-axis or y-axis.
- **Dilations:** Scaling the graph larger or smaller.

### 9. Intersection of Curves:
- Determining points where two curves intersect by solving their equations simultaneously.

### 10. Applications:
- **Problem Solving:** Coordinate geometry is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, computer graphics, and navigation, for tasks like plotting trajectories, analyzing forces, and designing structures.

Understanding these concepts allows one to solve complex geometric problems systematically by leveraging algebraic methods and the coordinate plane.
