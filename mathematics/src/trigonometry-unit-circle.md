# Trigonometry
## Unit Circle

The Unit Circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry and is essential for understanding the relationships between trigonometric functions and angles. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### Definition:
The Unit Circle is a circle with a radius of 1 unit, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane (0, 0).

### Basic Properties:
1. **Radius**: Since it is the Unit Circle, every radius of the circle is exactly 1 unit long.
2. **Center**: The center of the Unit Circle is at the coordinates (0, 0).

### Relationship to Trigonometric Functions:
The Unit Circle helps to define the sine, cosine, and tangent functions for all real numbers. Here’s how:

- **Cosine and Sine**: For any angle θ (measured in radians), the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the Unit Circle are (cos(θ), sin(θ)).
  - **Cosine (cos(θ))** is the x-coordinate of this point.
  - **Sine (sin(θ))** is the y-coordinate of this point.
  
- **Tangent**: The tangent function can be defined as the ratio of sine to cosine.
  - **Tangent (tan(θ))** = sin(θ) / cos(θ)
  
### Angle Measurement:
- **Radians**: Angles on the Unit Circle are typically measured in radians rather than degrees. One complete revolution around the circle is \(2\pi\) radians, which is equivalent to 360 degrees.
- **Key Angles**: Some important angles to remember and their corresponding coordinates are:
  - 0 or \(0^\circ\): (1, 0)
  - \(\pi/6\) or \(30^\circ\): \((\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\)
  - \(\pi/4\) or \(45^\circ\): \((\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2)\)
  - \(\pi/3\) or \(60^\circ\): \((1/2, \sqrt{3}/2)\)
  - \(\pi/2\) or \(90^\circ\): (0, 1)

### Symmetry and Periodicity:
- **Symmetry**:
  - The Unit Circle has symmetry about the x-axis, y-axis, and the origin.
  - This symmetry helps to understand the periodic nature of trigonometric functions.
  
- **Periodicity**:
  - The sine and cosine functions are periodic with a period of \(2\pi\).
  - This means \( \sin(\theta + 2\pi) = \sin(\theta) \) and \( \cos(\theta + 2\pi) = \cos(\theta) \).

### Applications:
- **Solving Trigonometric Equations**: The Unit Circle is used to solve trigonometric equations and to understand the values of trigonometric functions at various angles.
- **Understanding Waveforms**: In physics and engineering, the Unit Circle helps in understanding waveforms and oscillations.
- **Fourier Series**: It plays a role in Fourier series and Fourier transforms, which are used in signal processing.

### Visualization:
To visualize the Unit Circle and its relationship to trigonometric functions, you can imagine drawing a right triangle within the circle where the hypotenuse is the radius (1 unit), and the opposite and adjacent sides correspond to the sine and cosine values for a given angle.

In summary, the Unit Circle is a powerful tool in trigonometry, tying together angle measures with the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, and providing a clear geometric representation of these functions.
