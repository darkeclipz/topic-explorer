## Angle Measures

Angle measures are a fundamental concept in trigonometry, which deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, as well as the properties of circles. Understanding angle measures is crucial for solving various trigonometric problems. Here are the key aspects of angle measures in trigonometry:

1. **Units of Angle Measurement**:
   - **Degrees**: This is the most common unit for measuring angles. A full circle is 360 degrees, denoted as \(360^\circ\). Therefore:
     - \(90^\circ\) is a right angle.
     - \(180^\circ\) is a straight angle.
     - \(360^\circ\) completes a full circle.
   - **Radians**: This unit is often used in higher mathematics and physics. One radian is the angle created when the radius of a circle is wrapped around its circumference. A full circle is \(2\pi\) radians. Thus:
     - \( \pi \) radians is a straight angle (180 degrees).
     - \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians is a right angle (90 degrees).
     - \(2\pi\) radians is a full circle (360 degrees).

2. **Conversion Between Degrees and Radians**:
   - To convert from degrees to radians: Multiply the number of degrees by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).
     \[
     \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
     \]
   - To convert from radians to degrees: Multiply the number of radians by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).
     \[
     \text{Degrees} = \text{Radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
     \]

3. **Common Angles**:
   - Some angles have specific values in both degrees and radians that are frequently used in trigonometry:
     - \(0^\circ = 0\) radians
     - \(30^\circ = \frac{\pi}{6}\) radians
     - \(45^\circ = \frac{\pi}{4}\) radians
     - \(60^\circ = \frac{\pi}{3}\) radians
     - \(90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2}\) radians
     - \(180^\circ = \pi \) radians
     - \(270^\circ = \frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians
     - \(360^\circ = 2\pi \) radians

4. **Angle Relationships in Trigonometry**:
   - **Complementary Angles**: Two angles are complementary if their sum is \(90^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.
   - **Supplementary Angles**: Two angles are supplementary if their sum is \(180^\circ\) or \(\pi \) radians.

5. **Unit Circle**:
   - The unit circle is a circle with a radius of one, centered at the origin of a coordinate system.
   - Points on the unit circle correspond to angles measured in radians.
   - The x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle represents the cosine of the angle, and the y-coordinate represents the sine of the angle.
   - For a given angle \(\theta\):
     \[
     \cos{\theta} = x \quad \text{and} \quad \sin{\theta} = y
     \]
   - Key angles and their corresponding coordinates are:
     - \(0^\circ \text{ or } 0 \text{ radians} \): (1, 0)
     - \(90^\circ \text{ or } \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians} \): (0, 1)
     - \(180^\circ \text{ or } \pi \text{ radians} \): (-1, 0)
     - \(270^\circ \text{ or } \frac{3\pi}{2} \text{ radians} \): (0, -1)

Understanding these fundamental concepts about angle measures in trigonometry helps in various applications, such as solving triangles, modeling periodic phenomena, and analyzing oscillatory behavior in physics and engineering.
