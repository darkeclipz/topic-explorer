# Number Theory
## Divisibility

Divisibility is a fundamental concept in number theory that deals with how one integer can be evenly divided by another integer without leaving a remainder. Here's a detailed explanation of the concept along with related rules and properties:

### Basic Definition
An integer \( a \) is said to be divisible by another integer \( b \) (where \( b \) is not zero) if there exists an integer \( k \) such that:
\[ a = b \times k \]

In this case, we say that \( b \) is a divisor of \( a \) or \( a \) is a multiple of \( b \). We often use the notation \( b \mid a \) to signify that \( b \) divides \( a \).

### Divisibility Rules
There are specific rules that help determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually performing the division. Here are some common divisibility rules:

1. **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

2. **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

3. **Divisibility by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

4. **Divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.

5. **Divisibility by 6:** A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

6. **Divisibility by 7:** A common method is to double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number, and if the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number.

7. **Divisibility by 8:** A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.

8. **Divisibility by 9:** A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

9. **Divisibility by 10:** A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.

### Properties of Divisibility

1. **Transitivity:** If \( a \mid b \) and \( b \mid c \), then \( a \mid c \).

2. **Addition and Subtraction:** If \( a \mid b \) and \( a \mid c \), then \( a \mid (b + c) \) and \( a \mid (b - c) \).

3. **Multiplication:** If \( a \mid b \), then \( a \mid (b \times k) \) for any integer \( k \).

4. **GCD and LCM:**
   - **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both.
   - **Least Common Multiple (LCM):** The LCM of two integers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:** Determine if 124 is divisible by 4.
   - The last two digits of 124 are 24.
   - Since 24 is divisible by 4, 124 is also divisible by 4.

2. **Example 2:** Determine if 135 is divisible by 3.
   - Sum of the digits: \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \).
   - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 135 is also divisible by 3.

### Conclusion
Understanding divisibility is essential for various areas of number theory and for simplifying problems involving integers. Mastery of divisibility rules and their properties can significantly enhance problem-solving skills, especially in mathematical proofs and integer factorization.
