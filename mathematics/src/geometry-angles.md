# Geometry
## Angles

In geometry, an angle is formed by two rays (or line segments) that share a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. Angles are a fundamental concept in geometry because they are used to describe the orientation of lines and shapes. Here are key aspects and types of angles:

### Types of Angles
1. **Acute Angle**
   - Measures less than 90 degrees.
   - Example: An angle of 45 degrees.

2. **Right Angle**
   - Measures exactly 90 degrees.
   - Often denoted by a small square at the vertex.

3. **Obtuse Angle**
   - Measures more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
   - Example: An angle of 120 degrees.

4. **Straight Angle**
   - Measures exactly 180 degrees.
   - Essentially a straight line.

5. **Reflex Angle**
   - Measures more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
   - Example: An angle of 270 degrees.

### Angle Measurement
- **Degrees (°):** The most common unit for measuring angles.
- **Radians:** Another unit often used, especially in higher mathematics. \( \pi \) radians is equivalent to 180 degrees.

### Relationships Between Angles
1. **Complementary Angles**
   - Two angles that add up to 90 degrees.
   - Example: 30° and 60° are complementary.

2. **Supplementary Angles**
   - Two angles that add up to 180 degrees.
   - Example: 110° and 70° are supplementary.

3. **Adjacent Angles**
   - Share a common vertex and a common side but do not overlap.
   - Example: Angles ABD and DBC in a figure where point B is the vertex.

4. **Vertical Angles**
   - Formed when two lines intersect.
   - Opposite angles are equal.

5. **Corresponding Angles**
   - Occur when a transversal intersects two parallel lines.
   - Angles in matching corners are equal.

6. **Alternate Interior Angles**
   - Formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines.
   - Pairs of angles on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the parallel lines.
   - They are equal.

### Angle Bisector
- An angle bisector is a line or ray that divides an angle into two equal parts.
- The bisector of an angle creates two smaller angles that are each half the measure of the original angle.

### Practical Applications
- **Construction:** Understanding angles is crucial for creating buildings, furniture, and various structures.
- **Navigation:** Angles are used in navigation to plot courses and positions.
- **Art and Design:** Artists and designers use angles to create perspective and proportionality in their works.

### Tools for Measuring Angles
- **Protractor:** A semi-circular or circular tool marked with degrees from 0° to 180° (or 360°).
- **Angle Finder:** A tool specifically designed for finding and measuring angles in construction and carpentry.

Understanding angles and their properties is essential in various fields of study and practical applications, from engineering and architecture to art and everyday problem-solving.
