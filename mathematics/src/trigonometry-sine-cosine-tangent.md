# Trigonometry
## Sine, Cosine, Tangent

Sure! Sine, cosine, and tangent are fundamental trigonometric functions that relate the angles of a right triangle to the lengths of its sides. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:

### 1. **Sine (sin)**
The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

\[ 
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
\]

### 2. **Cosine (cos)**
The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side (the side that forms the angle with the hypotenuse) to the length of the hypotenuse.

\[ 
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
\]

### 3. **Tangent (tan)**
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.

\[ 
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}
\]

### Relationships Between the Functions:
- **Pythagorean Identity**: 

\[ 
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
\]

This identity is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

- **Quotient Identity**: 

\[ 
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
\]

### Unit Circle Explanation:
The unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane) provides a way to define these functions for all angles, not just those in a right triangle:

- For an angle \(\theta\), the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle are \((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\). 

### Examples:
Imagine a right triangle with an angle \(\theta\), where the length of the opposite side is 3 units, the adjacent side is 4 units, and the hypotenuse is 5 units:

- \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \)
- \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \)
- \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \)

These trigonometric functions are extensively used in various fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and even in everyday problem-solving. They are essential for understanding waves, oscillations, and circular motion to mention a few applications.
