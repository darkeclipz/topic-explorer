# Statistics
## Distributions

Distributions are a fundamental concept in statistics that describe how values in a dataset are spread or distributed. Essentially, a distribution gives us a way to understand the frequency of various outcomes in a dataset. Here are some key points about distributions:

### Types of Distributions

1. **Probability Distribution:**
   - **Definition:** Describes how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Discrete Distributions:** For variables that take on a finite number of values (e.g., Binomial, Poisson distributions).
     - **Continuous Distributions:** For variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a range (e.g., Normal, Exponential, Uniform distributions).

2. **Frequency Distribution:**
   - **Definition:** Shows how often each value in a dataset occurs.
   - **Examples:**
     - Histograms
     - Frequency tables

### Key Terms and Descriptions

1. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
   - Used for discrete random variables.
   - Provides the probabilities of individual outcomes.

2. **Probability Density Function (PDF):**
   - Used for continuous random variables.
   - Describes the likelihood of outcomes within a continuous range.

3. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
   - Used for both discrete and continuous random variables.
   - Shows the cumulative probability that the variable takes a value less than or equal to a particular value.

### Common Distributions

1. **Normal Distribution:**
   - Also known as the Gaussian distribution.
   - Features a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.
   - Defined by its mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ).

2. **Binomial Distribution:**
   - Used for binary outcomes (success/failure) in a fixed number of trials.
   - Defined by parameters n (number of trials) and p (probability of success).

3. **Poisson Distribution:**
   - Describes the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.
   - Defined by the rate parameter λ (average number of occurrences).

4. **Exponential Distribution:**
   - Describes the time between occurrences of successive events.
   - Defined by the rate parameter λ.

5. **Uniform Distribution:**
   - All outcomes are equally likely.
   - Defined over a specific range [a, b].

### Properties of Distributions

1. **Mean (Expected Value):**
   - The average or central value of a distribution.

2. **Variance:**
   - Measures the spread of the distribution, indicating the average degree to which each number differs from the mean.

3. **Skewness:**
   - Measures the asymmetry of the distribution.
   - Positive skew (tail on the right) vs. negative skew (tail on the left).

4. **Kurtosis:**
   - Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.
   - High kurtosis indicates heavy tails, while low kurtosis indicates light tails.

### Importance in Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Help to summarize and visualize data.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Allow us to make inferences about a population based on a sample.
- **Modeling:** Various statistical models rely heavily on assumptions about the underlying distribution of data.

Understanding distributions is crucial for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling. They provide the foundation for interpreting data and making decisions based on statistical evidence.
