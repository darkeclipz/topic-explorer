## Trigonometric Identities

Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all values of the variables involved where both sides of the equation are defined. These identities are fundamental in simplifying expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and proving other mathematical results.

Here are some key trigonometric identities:

### 1. Pythagorean Identities
- **Basic Pythagorean Identity**:
  \[
  \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
  \]
- By manipulating the basic Pythagorean Identity, we get:
  \[
  1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)
  \]
  \[
  1 + \cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x)
  \]

### 2. Reciprocal Identities
- These identities relate the primary trigonometric functions to their reciprocals:
  \[
  \sin(x) = \frac{1}{\csc(x)}, \quad \cos(x) = \frac{1}{\sec(x)}, \quad \tan(x) = \frac{1}{\cot(x)}
  \]
  \[
  \csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}, \quad \sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}, \quad \cot(x) = \frac{1}{\tan(x)}
  \]

### 3. Quotient Identities
- These identities express tangent and cotangent in terms of sine and cosine:
  \[
  \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}, \quad \cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}
  \]

### 4. Co-Function Identities
- These identities express the relationship between trigonometric functions of complementary angles:
  \[
  \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \cos(x), \quad \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \sin(x)
  \]
  \[
  \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \cot(x), \quad \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \tan(x)
  \]
  \[
  \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \csc(x), \quad \csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \sec(x)
  \]

### 5. Even-Odd Identities
- These identities involve the properties of trigonometric functions with respect to even and odd functions:
  \[
  \sin(-x) = -\sin(x), \quad \cos(-x) = \cos(x)
  \]
  \[
  \tan(-x) = -\tan(x), \quad \cot(-x) = -\cot(x)
  \]
  \[
  \sec(-x) = \sec(x), \quad \csc(-x) = -\csc(x)
  \]

### 6. Sum and Difference Formulas
- These identities deal with the sine, cosine, and tangent of the sum and difference of two angles:
  \[
  \sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b)
  \]
  \[
  \sin(a - b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) - \cos(a)\sin(b)
  \]
  \[
  \cos(a + b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b)
  \]
  \[
  \cos(a - b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) + \sin(a)\sin(b)
  \]
  \[
  \tan(a + b) = \frac{\tan(a) + \tan(b)}{1 - \tan(a)\tan(b)}
  \]
  \[
  \tan(a - b) = \frac{\tan(a) - \tan(b)}{1 + \tan(a)\tan(b)}
  \]

### 7. Double-Angle Formulas
- These identities express trigonometric functions of twice an angle in terms of functions of the original angle:
  \[
  \sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)
  \]
  \[
  \cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x) = 2\cos^2(x) - 1 = 1 - 2\sin^2(x)
  \]
  \[
  \tan(2x) = \frac{2\tan(x)}{1 - \tan^2(x)}
  \]

### 8. Half-Angle Formulas
- These identities express the trigonometric functions of half an angle in terms of the functions of the original angle:
  \[
  \sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(x)}{2}}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(x)}{2}}
  \]
  \[
  \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(x)}{1 + \cos(x)}} = \frac{\sin(x)}{1 + \cos(x)} = \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin(x)}
  \]

These trigonometric identities are heavily used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields. Understanding and being able to apply these identities is crucial for solving complex trigonometric problems.
