## Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable \( x \), with the general form:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, and \( a \neq 0 \) (if \( a = 0 \), the equation would be linear, not quadratic).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Standard Form**:
   The standard form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

2. **Solutions**:
   The solutions to the quadratic equation are the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation. These are called the roots of the equation.

3. **Factoring**:
   Some quadratic equations can be factored into the form:
   \[
   (px + q)(rx + s) = 0
   \]
   The solutions are found by setting each factor equal to zero:
   \[
   px + q = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad rx + s = 0
   \]

4. **Quadratic Formula**:
   For any quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \( \pm \) indicates that there are generally two solutions.

5. **Discriminant**:
   The expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, \( b^2 - 4ac \), is called the discriminant and is denoted by \( \Delta \). It indicates the nature of the roots:
   - If \( \Delta > 0 \): There are two distinct real roots.
   - If \( \Delta = 0 \): There is exactly one real root (repeated root).
   - If \( \Delta < 0 \): There are no real roots (the roots are complex numbers).

6. **Completing the Square**:
   This method involves rewriting the quadratic equation in the form:
   \[
   (x - h)^2 = k
   \]
   It is useful for understanding the derivation of the quadratic formula and for converting the equation into a form that reveals the vertex of the parabola.

### Example:

Consider the quadratic equation:

\[ 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \]

1. **Using the Quadratic Formula**:
   - Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = -6 \).
   - Discriminant, \( \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6) = 16 + 48 = 64 \).
   - Since \( \Delta = 64 \), which is greater than 0, there are two distinct real roots.
   - Applying the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2(2)} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = -1
     \]
   - Therefore, the solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).

Understanding quadratic equations not only equips one to solve a variety of mathematical problems but also provides a foundation for many topics in higher mathematics.
