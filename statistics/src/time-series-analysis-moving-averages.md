# Time Series Analysis
## Moving Averages

Moving Averages (MA) is a technique used in time series analysis to smooth out fluctuations in data and highlight underlying trends by averaging data points within a specified period.

### Types of Moving Averages

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
   - Calculated by averaging a set number of past data points.
   - Formula: \(SMA_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} Y_{t-i}\), where \(Y_t\) is the data point at time \(t\) and \(N\) is the number of points to average.

2. **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**:
   - Assigns different weights to each data point, usually giving more weight to recent observations.
   - Formula: \(WMA_t = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i Y_{t-i}}{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i}\), where \(w_i\) is the weight for the \(i\)-th point.

3. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
   - Applies more weight to recent data points exponentially.
   - Formula: \(EMA_t = \alpha \cdot Y_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot EMA_{t-1}\), where \(\alpha\) is the smoothing factor.

### Uses of Moving Averages

1. **Trend Identification**:
   - Helps to identify the direction of the trend (upward, downward, or sideways) by smoothing short-term fluctuations.
  
2. **Support and Resistance Levels**:
   - Used in technical analysis to identify support and resistance levels. For example, when prices fall and hit the moving average line, the line can act as support.

3. **Signal Generation**:
   - EMA is often used in trading algorithms for generating buy/sell signals. When a short-term EMA crosses above a long-term EMA, it might be a buy signal, and vice versa.

### Example Calculation (Simple Moving Average)
   
Suppose we have a time series of the past 5 days of stock prices: [100, 102, 104, 103, 105].

To calculate the 3-day SMA:
- For Day 3 (average of Day 1, 2, 3): \(SMA_3 = \frac{100 + 102 + 104}{3} = 102\)
- For Day 4 (average of Day 2, 3, 4): \(SMA_4 = \frac{102 + 104 + 103}{3} = 103\)
- For Day 5 (average of Day 3, 4, 5): \(SMA_5 = \frac{104 + 103 + 105}{3} = 104\)

So, the 3-day SMA for days 3, 4, 5 are [102, 103, 104].

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Easy to calculate and understand.
- Works well to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

**Disadvantages:**
- Lags behind the true data trend since itâ€™s based on past data.
- May not react quickly to changes in the trend, causing a delay in signal generation.
- Same weight to all data points can cause issues in SMA; whereas WMA and EMA can be more responsive but complex to calculate.
