# Descriptive Statistics
## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of Central Tendency are statistical tools used to summarize a set of data by identifying the central point within that data set. The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode, each providing different insights about the central value of the data.

### Mean
- **Definition**: The mean (also known as the average) is the sum of all the values in a data set divided by the number of values.
- **Formula**: \(\text{Mean} (\mu) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\)
  - Where \(x_i\) represents each value in the data set
  - \(n\) represents the number of values in the data set
- **Usage**: The mean is used when you want a measure that takes into account all the values in the data set.
- **Example**: For the data set \([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\), the mean is \( \frac{2+4+6+8+10}{5} = 6\).

### Median
- **Definition**: The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending (or descending) order. If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Formula**: 
  - For an odd number of values: It's the middle value.
  - For an even number of values: \( \text{Median} = \frac{\text{(n/2)th value} + \text{((n/2) + 1)th value}}{2} \)
  - Where \(n\) is the number of observations.
- **Usage**: The median is useful when a data set has outliers or is skewed, as it is not affected by extremely large or small values.
- **Example**: For the data set \([3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\), the median is \(7\). For the data set \([1, 3, 5, 7]\), the median is \( \frac{3+5}{2} = 4\).

### Mode
- **Definition**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A data set might have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all if no value repeats.
- **Usage**: The mode is particularly useful for categorical data where we wish to know the most common category.
- **Example**: For the data set \([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]\), the mode is \(4\).

### When to Use Each Measure
- **Mean**: When the data distribution is symmetrical and there are no outliers.
- **Median**: When the data distribution is skewed or has outliers.
- **Mode**: When the most frequent occurrence of a value is of interest, or the data is categorical.

By understanding and using these measures, you can effectively summarize and interpret data, providing a central point of reference within the dataset.
