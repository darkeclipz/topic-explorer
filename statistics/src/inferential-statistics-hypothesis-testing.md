# Inferential Statistics
## Hypothesis Testing

**Hypothesis Testing in Inferential Statistics**

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting data, and then determining whether the data supports the hypothesis or not. Here's an outline of key components in hypothesis testing:

### Key Components:

1. **Null Hypothesis (H0):**
   - The null hypothesis represents the status quo or default position. It assumes that there is no effect or no difference in the population.
   - Example: H0: The mean of the population is equal to a specified value (µ = µ0).

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):**
   - The alternative hypothesis represents what the researcher wants to prove. It suggests that there is an effect or a difference in the population.
   - Example: H1: The mean of the population is not equal to a specified value (µ ≠ µ0).

3. **Test Statistic:**
   - A test statistic is a standardized value calculated from sample data. It is used to determine the likelihood of the sample results under the null hypothesis.
   - Common test statistics include t-scores, z-scores, and chi-square values.

4. **Significance Level (α):**
   - The significance level is a threshold chosen by the researcher, typically set at 0.05 (5%). It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).
   - Example: α = 0.05.

5. **P-value:**
   - The p-value measures the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It helps in decision-making by comparing it to the significance level.
   - If the p-value ≤ α, the null hypothesis is rejected.

6. **Decision:**
   - Based on the p-value and the significance level, a decision is made to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
   - - **Reject H0:** If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level.
   - - **Fail to Reject H0:** If the p-value is greater than the significance level.

### Steps in Hypothesis Testing:

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - State the null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses clearly.
   
2. **Choose Significance Level (α):**
   - Decide the significance level for the test (commonly 0.05).

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather sample data through proper sampling methods.

4. **Calculate Test Statistic:**
   - Compute the test statistic based on the sample data using the appropriate formula.

5. **Compute P-value:**
   - Determine the p-value associated with the test statistic.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - Compare the p-value with the significance level and make a decision to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

7. **Draw Conclusions:**
   - Interpret the results in the context of the research question and write a meaningful conclusion.

### Example:

**Research Question:** Is the average weight of apples in a farm different from 150 grams?

- H0: µ = 150 grams (the mean weight of apples is 150 grams)
- H1: µ ≠ 150 grams (the mean weight of apples is not 150 grams)
- Significance Level: α = 0.05

After collecting data and performing the necessary calculations, you obtain a p-value of 0.02.

- Since the p-value (0.02) is less than the significance level (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:** There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the average weight of apples in the farm is different from 150 grams.
