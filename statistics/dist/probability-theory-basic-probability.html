<h1>Probability Theory</h1>
<h2>Basic Probability</h2>
<p>Sure, basic probability is a fundamental concept in statistics and mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of different outcomes. Here are some key aspects of basic probability:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Definition of Probability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probability (P):</strong> A measure of how likely an event is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Sample Space (S):</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
<ul>
<li>Example: For a coin toss, the sample space is ( S = { \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} } ).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Event (E):</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A subset of the sample space. It represents one or more outcomes.
<ul>
<li>Example: In rolling a die, the event of rolling an even number is ( E = {2, 4, 6} ).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Types of Events:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Events:</strong> Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
<ul>
<li>Example: Tossing a coin and rolling a die.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.
<ul>
<li>Example: Drawing an Ace and drawing a King from a standard deck of cards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Basic Probability Formulas:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Probability of an event ( E ):</strong>
[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
]</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Complementary Events:</strong>
[
P(E') = 1 - P(E)
]
where ( E' ) is the complement of event ( E ), which means ( E' ) is the event that ( E ) does not occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong>
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
]
where ( A \cup B ) is the event that either ( A ) or ( B ) or both occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>General Addition Rule:</strong>
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
]
where ( A \cap B ) is the event that both ( A ) and ( B ) occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiplication Rule for Independent Events:</strong>
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Conditional Probability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred is called conditional probability.
[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
]
where ( P(A | B) ) is the probability of event ( A ) occurring given that ( B ) has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Bayesâ€™ Theorem:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A powerful formula for finding probabilities that incorporates conditional probabilities.
[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
]</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. <strong>Law of Total Probability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If ( B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n ) are mutually exclusive events that cover the entire sample space, i.e., ( P(B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \dots \cup B_n) = 1 ), then for any event ( A ),
[
P(A) = P(A \cap B_1) + P(A \cap B_2) + \cdots + P(A \cap B_n)
]</li>
<li>In a simpler form:
[
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A | B_i) P(B_i)
]</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these fundamental principles, you can analyze random experiments and make informed predictions about the likelihood of various outcomes.</p>
