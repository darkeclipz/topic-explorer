<h1>Baking</h1>
<h2>Tarts</h2>
<p>Tarts are a type of baked pastry that consist of a shallow crust and a filling. They are similar to pies but typically differ in that pies often have a top crust, whereas tarts either don't have a top crust or have an open, decorative lattice pattern. Here are some key details about tarts:</p>
<h3>Types of Tarts</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sweet Tarts</strong>: Sweet tarts often include fillings like fruit, custard, chocolate, or other dessert ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruit Tart</strong>: Features a pastry crust filled with custard or cream and topped with fresh fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Lemon Tart</strong>: Has a citrusy lemon filling, often made with lemon curd.</li>
<li><strong>Chocolate Tart</strong>: Filled with rich chocolate ganache or mousse.</li>
<li><strong>Custard Tart</strong>: Filled with a creamy custard mixture, often topped with nutmeg or cinnamon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Savory Tarts</strong>: These are less sweet and include ingredients typically used in main courses or appetizers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quiche</strong>: A popular savory tart filled with a mixture of eggs, cheese, meat, and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Tomato Tart</strong>: Often includes tomatoes, cheese, herbs, and sometimes a custard base.</li>
<li><strong>Onion Tart</strong>: Features caramelized onions with or without cheese.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Components of Tarts</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Crust</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pâte Sucrée (Sweet Pastry)</strong>: Used for sweet tarts, it's a rich, slightly crumbly dough.</li>
<li><strong>Pâte Brisée (Shortcrust Pastry)</strong>: More neutral in flavor, suitable for both sweet and savory tarts.</li>
<li><strong>Puff Pastry</strong>: Occasionally used, especially for more intricate, layered tarts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Filling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruit Fillings</strong>: Whole, sliced, or pureed fruits, often sweetened and thickened.</li>
<li><strong>Custards</strong>: Mixtures of milk, cream, eggs, and sugar, which set when baked.</li>
<li><strong>Chocolates and Ganaches</strong>: Made from melted chocolate and cream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Blind Baking</strong>: Pre-baking the tart crust before adding the filling ensures it cooks through and stays crisp. This is particularly important for liquid fillings like custards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent puffing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Docking</strong>: Pricking the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape, preventing it from bubbling up during baking.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chilling the Dough</strong>: After rolling out the dough and placing it in the tart pan, chilling helps prevent shrinkage during baking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips for Perfect Tarts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Cold Butter</strong>: This helps create a flaky crust.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Overmixing</strong>: Overworking the dough can make it tough.</li>
<li><strong>Even Rolling</strong>: Roll the dough evenly to ensure uniform baking.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for Shrinkage</strong>: Rest the dough between rolling and baking to minimize shrinkage.</li>
<li><strong>Properly Thicken Fillings</strong>: If using fruit, ensure any juices are thickened to prevent a soggy crust.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tart Pan</strong>: Typically with a removable bottom for easier removal and presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Pin</strong>: For rolling out the dough evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Pastry Brush</strong>: For applying glazes or egg washes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tarts are versatile, delicious, and can be as simple or as elaborate as you desire. They are a great way to showcase seasonal produce and make an impressive dessert or savory meal.</p>
