# Cooking Techniques
## Seasoning

Seasoning in cooking refers to the process of adding spices, herbs, and other flavorings to food to enhance its taste. It is a fundamental cooking technique that can make a significant difference in the quality and appeal of a dish. Here are some key aspects of seasoning:

1. **Types of Seasonings**:
   - **Salt**: Enhances the natural flavors of food. Common types include table salt, sea salt, kosher salt, and flavored salts.
   - **Pepper**: Adds a bit of heat and complexity. Black pepper is most commonly used, but white, green, and pink peppercorns are also available.
   - **Herbs**: Fresh or dried leaves of plants used to add flavor. Examples include basil, parsley, thyme, rosemary, cilantro, and dill.
   - **Spices**: Dried seeds, roots, bark, or other plant substances used for flavoring. Common spices include cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
   - **Aromatics**: Ingredients like garlic, onions, ginger, and shallots that add depth to the flavor.
   - **Acidic Ingredients**: Vinegars, citrus juices, and other acidic components that brighten and balance flavors.

2. **Balancing Flavors**:
   - **Sweetness**: Adds balance to salty, bitter, or spicy ingredients. Common sweeteners include sugar, honey, and maple syrup.
   - **Bitterness**: Found in ingredients like kale, coffee, and dark chocolate, bitterness can enhance the complexity of a dish.
   - **Umami**: Known as the fifth taste, umami adds a savory depth to dishes. Ingredients like soy sauce, mushrooms, and aged cheese are rich in umami.
 
3. **When to Season**:
   - **Before Cooking**: Marinating meat or seasoning vegetables before cooking can infuse flavors deeply into the food.
   - **During Cooking**: Adding seasonings in stages can build layers of flavor. For example, start with onions and garlic, then add spices and herbs as the cooking progresses.
   - **After Cooking**: Finishing a dish with fresh herbs, a squeeze of lemon, or a sprinkle of sea salt can enhance the final flavors.

4. **Techniques for Seasoning**:
   - **Rubbing**: Rubbing spices and herbs onto the surface of meat or vegetables to create a flavorful crust.
   - **Sprinkling**: Evenly distributing seasonings like salt and pepper over food.
   - **Infusing**: Adding seasonings to oils or broths to create a flavored base for cooking.
   - **Tasting and Adjusting**: Continuously tasting your dish as you cook to check if more seasoning is needed.

5. **Common Seasoning Blends**:
   - **Italian Seasoning**: A blend of basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme.
   - **Curry Powder**: A mix of coriander, cumin, turmeric, and other spices.
   - **Herbes de Provence**: A mixture of thyme, rosemary, lavender, and other herbs.
   - **Garam Masala**: A blend of spices commonly used in Indian cuisine, including cardamom, cloves, cumin, and coriander.

Understanding and mastering seasoning allows cooks to create balanced, flavorful dishes that are well-rounded and enjoyable. Itâ€™s a skill that improves with practice, experimentation, and attentiveness to how ingredients interact.
