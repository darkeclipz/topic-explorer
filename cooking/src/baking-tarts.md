## Tarts

Tarts are a type of baked pastry that consist of a shallow crust and a filling. They are similar to pies but typically differ in that pies often have a top crust, whereas tarts either don't have a top crust or have an open, decorative lattice pattern. Here are some key details about tarts:

### Types of Tarts
1. **Sweet Tarts**: Sweet tarts often include fillings like fruit, custard, chocolate, or other dessert ingredients.
    - **Fruit Tart**: Features a pastry crust filled with custard or cream and topped with fresh fruits.
    - **Lemon Tart**: Has a citrusy lemon filling, often made with lemon curd.
    - **Chocolate Tart**: Filled with rich chocolate ganache or mousse.
    - **Custard Tart**: Filled with a creamy custard mixture, often topped with nutmeg or cinnamon.

2. **Savory Tarts**: These are less sweet and include ingredients typically used in main courses or appetizers.
    - **Quiche**: A popular savory tart filled with a mixture of eggs, cheese, meat, and vegetables.
    - **Tomato Tart**: Often includes tomatoes, cheese, herbs, and sometimes a custard base.
    - **Onion Tart**: Features caramelized onions with or without cheese.

### Components of Tarts
1. **Crust**: 
    - **Pâte Sucrée (Sweet Pastry)**: Used for sweet tarts, it's a rich, slightly crumbly dough.
    - **Pâte Brisée (Shortcrust Pastry)**: More neutral in flavor, suitable for both sweet and savory tarts.
    - **Puff Pastry**: Occasionally used, especially for more intricate, layered tarts.

2. **Filling**: 
    - **Fruit Fillings**: Whole, sliced, or pureed fruits, often sweetened and thickened.
    - **Custards**: Mixtures of milk, cream, eggs, and sugar, which set when baked.
    - **Chocolates and Ganaches**: Made from melted chocolate and cream.

### Techniques
1. **Blind Baking**: Pre-baking the tart crust before adding the filling ensures it cooks through and stays crisp. This is particularly important for liquid fillings like custards.
    - **Method**: Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent puffing.

2. **Docking**: Pricking the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape, preventing it from bubbling up during baking.

3. **Chilling the Dough**: After rolling out the dough and placing it in the tart pan, chilling helps prevent shrinkage during baking.

### Tips for Perfect Tarts
1. **Use Cold Butter**: This helps create a flaky crust.
2. **Avoid Overmixing**: Overworking the dough can make it tough.
3. **Even Rolling**: Roll the dough evenly to ensure uniform baking.
4. **Watch for Shrinkage**: Rest the dough between rolling and baking to minimize shrinkage.
5. **Properly Thicken Fillings**: If using fruit, ensure any juices are thickened to prevent a soggy crust.

### Equipment
1. **Tart Pan**: Typically with a removable bottom for easier removal and presentation.
2. **Rolling Pin**: For rolling out the dough evenly.
3. **Pastry Brush**: For applying glazes or egg washes.

Tarts are versatile, delicious, and can be as simple or as elaborate as you desire. They are a great way to showcase seasonal produce and make an impressive dessert or savory meal.
