Cookware refers to the various types of pots, pans, and related tools that are used in the kitchen to prepare and cook food. Here are some key categories and examples of cookware:

### 1. **Pots**
- **Stockpots**: Large, deep pots with tall sides, used for making stocks, soups, and boiling pasta.
- **Saucepans**: Smaller pots with a long handle, good for making sauces, heating liquids, and cooking small portions.

### 2. **Pans**
- **Frying Pans/Skillets**: Flat-bottomed pans with shallow sides, used for frying, sautéing, and browning foods.
- **Sauce Pans**: Similar to frying pans but with higher and straight sides, used for making sauces and cooking stews.
- **Grill Pans**: Pans with raised ridges that imitate the grill marks you would get from cooking on an outdoor grill.

### 3. **Specialty Pans**
- **Dutch Ovens**: Heavy, thick-walled pots with tight-fitting lids, ideal for slow-cooking, braising, and baking.
- **Woks**: Round-bottomed pans with high, sloping sides, used in Asian cooking for stir-frying, steaming, and deep-frying.
- **Saute Pans**: Similar to frying pans but often come with lids and have higher sides, used for sautéing and making dishes that require covered cooking.

### 4. **Baking Dishes**
- **Baking Sheets/Cookie Sheets**: Flat, rectangular metal pans used for baking cookies, roasting vegetables, and other oven tasks.
- **Casserole Dishes**: Deep, oven-safe dishes often made of glass or ceramic, used for baked dishes like lasagna and casseroles.
- **Pie Pans**: Round dishes with sloped sides used for baking pies.

### 5. **Roasting Equipment**
- **Roasting Pans**: Large pans with low sides, often come with a rack for cooking large pieces of meat like turkeys and roasts.
- **Ramekins**: Small, individual-sized dishes used for baking single servings of dishes like soufflés and crème brûlée.

### 6. **Cookware Materials**
- **Nonstick**: Coated with a material that prevents food from sticking, making it easier to cook with less oil and to clean.
- **Stainless Steel**: Durable and resistant to rust and corrosion, ideal for browning and deglazing.
- **Cast Iron**: Retains and distributes heat evenly, used for frying, baking, and stewing.
- **Copper**: Excellent heat conductivity, often lined with stainless steel for better cooking performance.
- **Ceramic**: Good for nonstick cooking and often used for baking dishes.

### 7. **Additional Cookware**
- **Pressure Cookers**: Sealed vessels that use steam pressure to cook food quickly.
- **Slow Cookers/Crockpots**: Electric appliances designed for long, slow cooking, perfect for stews and soups.
- **Steamers**: Pots or inserts with perforated bottoms used for steaming vegetables, fish, and other foods.

### 8. **Cookware Accessories**
- **Lids**: Often come with pots and pans, used to cover dishes while cooking to retain heat and moisture.
- **Handles**: Many pans have ergonomic handles for better grip. Some are designed to be oven-safe.
- **Cooking Racks**: Often included in roasting pans to elevate the food for even cooking and to allow fat to drip off.

Choosing the right cookware can significantly impact your cooking results and efficiency. Each type of cookware serves specific purposes, so it's helpful to have a variety of pieces suited to different cooking methods and recipes.
