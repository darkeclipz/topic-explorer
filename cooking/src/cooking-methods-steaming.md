# Cooking Methods
## Steaming

Steaming is a versatile and healthful cooking method that involves cooking food through the use of steam heat. Here is an overview of what you need to know about steaming:

### Overview of Steaming

**Definition:**
Steaming is a method of cooking where food is placed in a perforated basket or a steaming tray above boiling water. The steam generated from the boiling water surrounds the food, cooking it evenly and gently.

### Benefits of Steaming

1. **Preserves Nutrients:**
   - Steaming helps retain vitamins and minerals that can be lost during other cooking methods like boiling or frying.
   
2. **Low Fat:**
   - Since steaming doesn’t require cooking oil, it is a lower-fat cooking method.
   
3. **Enhances Flavor:**
   - Steaming preserves the natural flavors of the food without the need for heavy seasonings or sauces.
   
4. **Maintains Texture:**
   - Steamed foods tend to maintain their shape and texture better than boiled foods.

### Common Equipment for Steaming

1. **Steamer Basket:**
   - A simple and commonly used tool that can be placed inside a pot or saucepan above boiling water.

2. **Electric Steamer:**
   - A specialized appliance designed for steaming with multiple tiers to cook different foods simultaneously.
   
3. **Bamboo Steamer:**
   - Often used in Asian cuisine, these stackable steamers are placed over a wok or pot of boiling water.
   
4. **Microwave Steamer:**
   - Specially designed containers that allow for steaming food in the microwave.

### Foods Commonly Steamed

### Basic Steps to Steam Food

1. **Prepare Water:**
   - Fill a pot with water. The amount depends on the type of steamer used but generally should not touch the food.
   
2. **Position the Steamer:**
   - Place a steamer basket, steamer insert, or bamboo steamer over the pot with the water.
   
3. **Heat the Water:**
   - Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a steady stream of steam.
   
4. **Add Food:**
   - Place the food in a single layer in the steamer basket, ensuring steam can circulate around it.
   
5. **Cover and Steam:**
   - Cover the steamer with a lid to keep the steam in and cook the food until it’s done. Cooking times vary depending on the type and size of food being steamed.
   
6. **Check for Doneness:**
   - Use a fork or knife to see if the food is tender and cooked through. If it’s not ready, continue steaming a bit longer.
   
### Tips for Effective Steaming

1. **Uniform Size:**
   - Cut food into uniform sizes to ensure even cooking.
   
2. **Avoid Overcrowding:**
   - Arrange food in a single layer without overcrowding to allow steam to circulate properly.
   
3. **Flavored Steam:**
   - Add herbs, spices, or aromatics like lemon slices or ginger to the boiling water to infuse the food with additional flavors.

By mastering the technique of steaming, you can prepare a variety of dishes that are both nutritious and delicious.
