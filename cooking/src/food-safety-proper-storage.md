# Food Safety
## Proper Storage

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining food safety and ensuring that your ingredients remain fresh and free from contamination. Here are the key aspects of proper food storage:

### 1. **Temperature Control**
   - **Refrigeration (32°F - 40°F / 0°C - 4°C):** Perishable items like dairy products, meats, seafood, and some fruits and vegetables should be stored in the refrigerator to slow down bacterial growth.
   - **Freezing (0°F / -18°C):** Freezing food preserves it for longer periods. Most frozen foods can be kept for several months, but it's important to monitor for freezer burn and ensure items are properly wrapped.
   - **Room Temperature (60°F - 70°F / 16°C - 21°C):** Non-perishable items such as dry pasta, canned goods, and grains can be stored at room temperature in a cool, dry place.

### 2. **Proper Wrapping and Containers**
   - **Airtight Containers:** Use airtight containers to store dry goods and leftovers. This prevents exposure to air and moisture, which can lead to spoilage and contamination.
   - **Plastic and Glass Containers:** Depending on the type of food, consider using BPA-free plastic containers or glass containers that are less likely to affect the quality of the food.
   - **Vacuum Sealing:** Removing air from packaging can extend the shelf life of both refrigerated and frozen foods.

### 3. **First In, First Out (FIFO)**
   - **Label and Date:** Always label and date food items before storing them. Place newer items behind older ones to ensure older items are used first, reducing waste and the risk of consuming expired food.

### 4. **Separate Storage**
   - **Raw and Cooked Foods:** Keep raw foods, especially meats, poultry, and seafood, separate from cooked foods to avoid cross-contamination.
   - **Different Types of Produce:** Some fruits and vegetables emit ethylene gas, which can speed up ripening and spoilage of other produce. For example, store bananas, avocados, tomatoes, and apples away from other fruits and vegetables.

### 5. **Proper Storage Locations**
   - **Pantry:** Keep your pantry cool, dry, and well-ventilated. Common pantry items include grains, canned goods, oils, spices, and dry beans.
   - **Refrigerator:** Keep the refrigerator organized with designated sections for dairy, meats, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid overcrowding to allow for proper ventilation.
   - **Freezer:** Use the freezer for long-term storage. Keep a checklist of items in the freezer along with dates to easily track what needs to be used first.

### 6. **Cleaning and Maintenance**
   - **Regular Cleaning:** Clean your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry regularly to prevent mold, bacteria, and pests.
   - **Check Seals:** Ensure that refrigerator and freezer seals are working properly to maintain consistent temperatures.
   - **Check Expiration Dates:** Periodically check expiration dates on packaged foods and discard any items that are past their prime.

### 7. **Understanding Shelf Life**
   - **Know the Shelf Life:** Familiarize yourself with the typical shelf life of different types of food, both perishable and non-perishable.
   - **Best Before vs. Use By:** Understand the difference between "best before" dates, which indicate peak quality, and "use by" dates, which are more critical for safety.

### Additional Tips:
   - **Avoid Overbuying:** Purchase only what you can reasonably consume within the recommended storage duration to minimize food waste.
   - **Cool Down Hot Foods:** Allow hot foods to cool down before placing them in the refrigerator or freezer to avoid raising the temperature of surrounding items.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your food stays fresh and safe to eat, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses and maintaining the quality of your ingredients.
