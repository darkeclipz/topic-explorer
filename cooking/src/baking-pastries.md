## Pastries

Pastries are a type of baked good that typically feature a flaky, buttery, or doughy texture and are often sweet but can also be savory. Below are some key aspects about pastries:

**Types of Pastries:**
1. **Puff Pastry**: This is a light, flaky, and buttery pastry made by layering dough and butter and rolling it multiple times. It's used for items like croissants, turnovers, and pastry shells.
2. **Shortcrust Pastry**: A crumbly and rich pastry, typically used for tarts, quiches, and pies. It's made with flour, fat (like butter or lard), and sometimes sugar.
3. **Choux Pastry**: A light dough that puffs up to create hollow pastries, used in items like éclairs, profiteroles, and cream puffs.
4. **Filo (Phyllo) Pastry**: Extremely thin dough layers, used mainly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines for dishes like baklava and spanakopita.
5. **Danish Pastry**: A sweet, buttery yeast-leavened dough, often enriched with eggs and milk, and typically filled with fruit, cream cheese, or custard.

**Basic Ingredients:**
- **Flour**: The main structure builder in pastry.
- **Fat**: Usually butter, sometimes lard or shortening. The type and amount of fat determine the flakiness and richness.
- **Liquid**: Typically water or milk to bind the dough together.
- **Eggs**: Often used in enriched doughs for additional structure and richness.
- **Sugar**: Adds sweetness and can impact texture and browning.
- **Salt**: Enhances flavor.

**Key Techniques:**
1. **Cutting in fat**: For shortcrust pastry, fat is "cut into" flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. This helps create a crumbly texture.
2. **Folding and rolling**: For puff pastry, dough is rolled out and folded multiple times to create thin layers of fat and dough, enabling it to puff up during baking.
3. **Chilling**: Keeping the dough cold helps solidify the fat, making the pastry flakier.
4. **Baking**: Pastries are generally baked at high temperatures to ensure the layers separate and become crisp.

**Common Examples:**
- **Croissants**: Made from laminated dough with yeast, layered with butter.
- **Éclairs**: Made from choux pastry, filled with cream, and topped with chocolate glaze.
- **Tarts**: Often made from shortcrust pastry, can be sweet (like fruit tarts) or savory (like quiche).
- **Baklava**: Layers of filo pastry, filled with nuts, and soaked in honey.

**Preparation Tips:**
- **Cold Ingredients**: Use cold butter and cold water to keep the fat from melting before baking, which helps in achieving a flaky texture.
- **Minimal Handling**: Overworking the dough can develop gluten, making the pastry tough. Handle the dough as little as possible.
- **Proper Baking**: Ensure an even, golden-brown finish by rotating the tray if needed and making sure the oven is preheated.

Pastries can be intricate and time-consuming to make, but mastering these techniques can lead to delicious and impressive results!
