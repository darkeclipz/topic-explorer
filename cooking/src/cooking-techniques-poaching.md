# Cooking Techniques
## Poaching

Poaching is a gentle cooking technique that involves cooking food by submerging it in liquid at a relatively low temperature, typically between 160°F (71°C) and 180°F (82°C). This method is particularly suitable for delicate foods that might otherwise dry out or fall apart if subjected to the high heat of boiling, frying, or grilling.

### Key Elements of Poaching:

1. **Liquid:**
   - **Water:** The most basic poaching liquid, often used for meats and eggs.
   - **Broth or Stock:** Adds more flavor to the food being poached, commonly used for meats and vegetables.
   - **Wine or Beer:** Adds depth of flavor and complexity. Commonly used for seafood and poultry.
   - **Milk or Cream:** Adds richness, often used for fish or poultry.
   - **Aromatics:** Ingredients like herbs, spices, onions, garlic, and citrus can be added to the poaching liquid to infuse additional flavors.

2. **Temperature:**
   - The liquid should be at a gentle simmer, with small bubbles occasionally breaking the surface. If the liquid is boiling vigorously, the temperature is too high and could result in tough or disintegrated food.

3. **Time:**
   - Poaching times vary based on the type and size of the food. Generally, the process is faster than braising but slower than boiling. Overcooking can lead to a loss of texture and flavor.

### Steps to Poach Effectively:

1. **Prepare the Poaching Liquid:**
   - Place your chosen liquid in a pot or pan large enough to hold the food comfortably.
   - Add any aromatics or seasonings you wish to use.

2. **Heat the Liquid:**
   - Bring the liquid to the desired poaching temperature. Use a thermometer to ensure it stays between 160°F (71°C) and 180°F (82°C).

3. **Add the Food:**
   - Gently place the food into the poaching liquid. Ensure it is fully submerged for even cooking.

4. **Monitor Cooking:**
   - Keep a close watch on the temperature and adjust the heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.
   - Check the food periodically for doneness. Depending on the ingredient, use a fork, skewer, or thermometer to assess whether it's cooked through.

5. **Remove and Serve:**
   - Once the food is done, carefully remove it from the liquid using a slotted spoon or tongs.
   - Serve immediately or as specified in your recipe.

### Common Foods Poached:

- **Eggs:** Poached eggs are a popular dish where the whites are cooked thoroughly, and the yolks remain runny.
- **Fish:** Poaching in a flavorful broth or court bouillon preserves the delicateness of the fish.
- **Chicken:** Poached chicken stays moist and can be used in soups, salads, or sandwiches.
- **Fruit:** Poaching fruits like pears in a sweet syrup infuses them with flavor and makes an elegant dessert.

### Tips for Poaching Success:

- **Use Fresh Ingredients:** Because poaching is a gentle cooking method, the quality of your ingredients will directly impact the final dish.
- **Flavorful Liquids:** The poaching liquid should taste good because the flavors will be absorbed by the food.
- **Patience:** Maintain the low temperature throughout to ensure even, gentle cooking.

By understanding and mastering poaching, you can prepare tender, flavorful dishes with a subtle depth that highlights the natural characteristics of your ingredients.
