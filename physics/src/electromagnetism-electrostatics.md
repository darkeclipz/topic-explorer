## Electrostatics

Electrostatics is a branch of electromagnetism that focuses on the study of electric charges at rest. It examines how stationary charges interact with each other and create electric fields. Here are some key concepts and principles in electrostatics:

### 1. **Electric Charge**
   - **Fundamental Property**: Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that comes in two types: positive and negative.
   - **Units**: The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C).
   - **Conservation of Charge**: Charge is conserved, meaning the total charge in an isolated system remains constant.

### 2. **Coulomb’s Law**
   - **Force between Charges**: Coulomb’s Law describes the force between two point charges. The force (\(F\)) is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges (\(q_1\) and \(q_2\)) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (\(r\)) between them.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
     \]
     where \(k_e\) (the Coulomb constant) is approximately \(8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2\).

### 3. **Electric Field**
   - **Definition**: An electric field (\(E\)) is a vector field that describes the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge placed within the field.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     E = \frac{F}{q}
     \]
     where \(F\) is the force experienced by a test charge \(q\).
   - **Field Due to Point Charge**:
     \[
     E = k_e \frac{|q|}{r^2}
     \]

### 4. **Electric Potential Energy**
   - **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy (\(U\)) of a system of charges depends on their positions and the magnitudes of the charges.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     U = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
     \]

### 5. **Electric Potential (Voltage)**
   - **Definition**: Electric potential (\(V\)) is the electric potential energy per unit charge.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     V = \frac{U}{q} = k_e \frac{q}{r}
     \]
   - **Potential Difference**: The potential difference between two points is the work done to move a unit positive charge from one point to the other.

### 6. **Gauss’s Law**
   - **Electric Flux**: The electric flux (\(\Phi_E\)) through a surface is a measure of the quantity of electric field lines passing through that surface.
   - **Gauss’s Law**: States that the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed electric charge.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
     \]
     where \(Q_{\text{enc}}\) is the total charge enclosed and \(\epsilon_0\) (the permittivity of free space) is approximately \(8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N m}^2)\).

### 7. **Conductors and Insulators**
   - **Conductors**: Materials in which electric charges can move freely. In electrostatics, excess charge resides on the surface of conductors.
   - **Insulators**: Materials in which electric charges do not move freely.

### 8. **Capacitors and Capacitance**
   - **Definition**: A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field.
   - **Capacitance**: Capacitance (\(C\)) is defined as the ratio of the charge (\(Q\)) on one plate of the capacitor to the potential difference (\(V\)) between the plates.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     C = \frac{Q}{V}
     \]
   - **Unit**: The SI unit of capacitance is the Farad (F).

Understanding electrostatics is fundamental for further study in electromagnetism, electronics, and various applications in physics and engineering.
