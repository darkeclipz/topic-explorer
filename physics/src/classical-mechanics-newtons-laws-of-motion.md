# Classical Mechanics
## Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's Laws of Motion are three fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws are foundational to classical mechanics and can be summarized as follows:

### First Law: Law of Inertia
**Statement:** An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.

**Explanation:**
- This law essentially defines inertia, the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.
- Essentially, if no net external force acts on an object, there will be no change in its velocity.

**Example:**
- A book lying on a table remains stationary unless someone pushes it. Similarly, a hockey puck sliding on ice will keep moving at a constant speed in a straight line unless friction, a wall, or some other force stops it.

### Second Law: Law of Acceleration
**Statement:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net external force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, it is expressed as \( F = ma \) where:
- \( F \) represents the net force acting on the object,
- \( m \) represents the mass of the object,
- \( a \) represents the acceleration of the object.

**Explanation:**
- This law quantifies the effect of forces on the motion of an object.
- The greater the force applied to an object, the greater its acceleration will be, and conversely, the greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate in response to the same force.

**Example:**
- Pushing a child on a swing will make the child accelerate, but pushing an SUV with the same force will result in much less acceleration due to the SUV's greater mass.

### Third Law: Action and Reaction
**Statement:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Explanation:**
- This law states that forces always occur in pairs. If an object A exerts a force on object B, object B will exert an equal and opposite force on object A.
- This can be seen in interactions where forces are exchanged, and there is no isolated force.

**Example:**
- When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with equal force. When a rocket expels gas outwards (action), the rocket itself is propelled in the opposite direction (reaction).

### Summary
Newton's Laws of Motion are fundamental to understanding how objects move and interact under the influence of various forces. The first law introduces the concept of inertia, the second provides the quantitative relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, and the third law emphasizes that all forces occur in interacting pairs. These principles are widely applied in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to astrophysics and are foundational in the study of classical mechanics.
