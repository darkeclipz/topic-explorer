# Classical Mechanics
## Gravitation

Gravitation is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to be attracted to one another. It is a key topic in classical mechanics and has been studied extensively, particularly through the work of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Here's an overview of gravitation as it pertains to classical mechanics:

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Isaac Newton formulated the Law of Universal Gravitation, which states:
\[ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \]

where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force between two masses.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)).
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects.
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

### Key Concepts

#### Gravitational Field
The gravitational field \(\mathbf{g}\) at a point in space is defined as the gravitational force \(\mathbf{F}\) experienced by a unit mass placed at that point. Mathematically, the gravitational field due to a mass \( M \) at a distance \( r \) is given by:
\[ \mathbf{g} = -G \frac{M}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}} \]
where \( \mathbf{\hat{r}} \) is a unit vector pointing from the mass \( M \) to the point where the field is being calculated.

#### Gravitational Potential Energy
The gravitational potential energy \( U \) of an object of mass \( m \) at a distance \( r \) from a mass \( M \) is given by:
\[ U = -G \frac{m M}{r} \]
This is a scalar quantity and represents the work done to bring the object from infinity to the distance \( r \).

#### Orbits and Kepler's Laws
Gravitational forces govern the motion of planets, satellites, and other celestial bodies. Johannes Kepler formulated three laws based on empirical observations:
1. **Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)**:
   - Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the foci.
2. **Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)**:
   - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3. **Kepler's Third Law (Law of Harmonies)**:
   - The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit:
\[ T^2 \propto a^3 \]
where \( T \) is the orbital period and \( a \) is the semi-major axis.

### Applications of Gravitation
- **Planetary Motion**: Understanding the orbits of planets around the Sun.
- **Satellites**: Calculating the orbits of man-made satellites around Earth.
- **Tides**: The gravitational forces between Earth, the Moon, and the Sun cause ocean tides.
- **Gravitational Potential**: Used in calculating escape velocity and energy requirements for space missions.

### Limitations
- **Classical Limitations**: Newton's law works well for weak gravitational fields and slow velocities relative to the speed of light. However, it fails to explain phenomena such as the precession of Mercuryâ€™s orbit, which is accurately described by General Relativity.

By understanding these fundamental principles, one can analyze and predict the behavior of objects under the influence of gravitational forces within the framework of classical mechanics.
