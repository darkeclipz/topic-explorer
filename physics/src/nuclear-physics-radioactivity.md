# Nuclear Physics
## Radioactivity

Radioactivity is a phenomenon in nuclear physics where an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. This process leads to the transformation of an element into another, often more stable, element or isotope. Here are the key aspects of radioactivity:

### Types of Radioactive Decay
1. **Alpha Decay (α-decay):**
   - Involves the emission of an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (essentially a helium nucleus). 
   - Example: \( ^{238}_92 \text{U} \rightarrow ^{234}_90 \text{Th} + ^{4}_2 \text{He} \)

2. **Beta Decay (β-decay):**
   - Involves the emission of a beta particle, which can be an electron (\( \beta^- \)) or a positron (\( \beta^+ \)).
   - **Beta-minus decay (β^-):** A neutron transforms into a proton, releasing an electron and an antineutrino.
     - Example: \( ^{14}_6 \text{C} \rightarrow ^{14}_7 \text{N} + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e \)
   - **Beta-plus decay (β^+):** A proton transforms into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino.
     - Example: \( ^{22}_{11}\text{Na} \rightarrow ^{22}_{10}\text{Ne} + e^+ + \nu_e \)

3. **Gamma Decay (γ-decay):**
   - Involves the emission of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons.
   - Gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay, as the daughter nucleus remains in an excited state and releases excess energy in the form of gamma radiation.

4. **Neutron Emission:**
   - Some heavy nuclei may emit neutrons directly. 
   - Neutron emission can occur naturally or as a result of nuclear reactions.

### Measures of Radioactivity
- **Half-Life (T₁/₂):** 
  - The time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to undergo decay.
  - Example: The half-life of Carbon-14 (\(^{14}_6 \text{C}\)) is about 5730 years.

- **Activity (A):** 
  - The rate at which a sample of radioactive material decays, usually measured in becquerels (Bq) or curies (Ci).
  - It is defined as \( A = \lambda N \), where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( N \) is the number of radioactive atoms.

### Applications of Radioactivity
- **Medical Imaging and Treatment:**
  - Radioisotopes are used in diagnostic techniques (e.g., PET scans) and treatment (e.g., radiation therapy for cancer).
  
- **Archaeological Dating:**
  - Radioactive isotopes such as Carbon-14 are used to date ancient artifacts and fossils (radiocarbon dating).
  
- **Energy Production:**
  - Nuclear power plants use controlled fission reactions of uranium or plutonium isotopes to generate energy.
  
- **Industrial Uses:**
  - Radioisotopes are used for material inspection, such as checking welds and detecting leaks.

Radioactivity is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics that has significant implications in various fields, from medicine and archaeology to energy production and industrial applications. Understanding the different types of radioactive decay and their properties is critical for harnessing the power of nuclear processes safely and effectively.
