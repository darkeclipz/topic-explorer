## Wave-Particle Duality

Wave-Particle Duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes how every particle or quantum entity, such as an electron or photon, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

### Historical Background
- **Wave Nature of Light**: Initially, light was understood primarily as a wave, demonstrated by phenomena like interference and diffraction. 
- **Particle Nature of Light**: In the early 20th century, experiments showed that light also behaves as a stream of particles called photons. The photoelectric effect, where light ejects electrons from a metal surface, was explained by Albert Einstein using the concept of photons.

### Key Experiments and Theories
1. **Double-Slit Experiment**: When particles such as electrons are fired at a barrier with two slits, they produce an interference pattern on a detector screen, similar to waves. However, when particles are observed going through the slits, they behave like particles, going through one slit or the other. This experiment shows both wave and particle behavior in a single experiment.

2. **De Broglie Hypothesis**: In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that particles such as electrons also have an associated wavelength, given by \(\lambda = \frac{h}{p}\), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength, \(h\) is Planck’s constant, and \(p\) is the momentum of the particle. This implied that matter particles could exhibit wave-like properties.

3. **Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states that one cannot simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. This limitation is a natural consequence of wave-particle duality and further supports the dual nature of quantum entities.

### Implications
- **Wavefunctions**: In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wavefunctions, mathematical functions that encapsulate the probabilities of finding a particle in various positions. The square of the wavefunction’s absolute value gives the probability distribution of the particle's position.

- **Quantization**: Phenomena like the discrete energy levels of electrons in atoms can be understood through the wave nature of particles, as electrons can only occupy states that fit around the nucleus in whole-number multiples of their wavelength.

### Summary
Wave-particle duality reveals that our classical intuitions about waves and particles are insufficient to describe the behavior of quantum entities. Depending on the experimental setup, particles can exhibit properties traditionally associated with waves (such as interference and diffraction) or particles (such as discrete impacts on a detector). This duality is one of the core concepts of quantum mechanics and highlights the inherently probabilistic nature of the microscopic world.
