<h1>Electromagnetism</h1>
<h2>Electric Circuits</h2>
<p>Electric circuits are an integral part of electromagnetism and are fundamental to understanding the flow of electric current. Here are the key concepts related to electric circuits:</p>
<h3>Basic Components</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resistors</strong>: Components that resist the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Ω).</li>
<li><strong>Capacitors</strong>: Components that store electrical energy in an electric field, measured in farads (F).</li>
<li><strong>Inductors</strong>: Components that store energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through them, measured in henrys (H).</li>
<li><strong>Voltage Sources</strong>: Devices that provide a potential difference (voltage) in a circuit, such as batteries or power supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Current Sources</strong>: Devices that provide a constant current.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Voltage (V)</strong>: The potential difference between two points in a circuit, measured in volts (V). It drives the current through the circuit.</li>
<li><strong>Current (I)</strong>: The flow of electric charge in a circuit, measured in amperes (A).</li>
<li><strong>Resistance (R)</strong>: The opposition to the flow of current, measured in ohms (Ω).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
<p>Ohm's Law states that the current (I) passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R). Mathematically, it is expressed as:
[ V = IR ]</p>
<h3>Circuit Types</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Series Circuits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows through each component.</li>
<li>The total resistance (R_total) is the sum of individual resistances:
[ R_\text{total} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n ]</li>
<li>Voltage across each component varies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Parallel Circuits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components are connected across the same two points, so the voltage across each component is the same.</li>
<li>The total resistance (R_total) is found using the reciprocal sum of the individual resistances:
[ \frac{1}{R_\text{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n} ]</li>
<li>Current through each component varies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Kirchhoff’s Laws</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)</strong>: The algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in a circuit is zero.
[ \sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out} ]</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)</strong>: The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.
[ \sum V = 0 ]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Power in Electric Circuits</h3>
<p>Power (P) in an electric circuit is the rate at which energy is consumed or supplied. It is calculated as:
[ P = VI ]
[ P = I^2R ] (using Ohm's law)
[ P = \frac{V^2}{R} ] (using Ohm's law)</p>
<h3>Advanced Topics</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>AC (Alternating Current) Circuits</strong>: Where the current and voltage vary sinusoidally with time. These circuits may involve additional components like inductors and capacitors, and concepts like reactance and impedance.</li>
<li><strong>RC, RL, and RLC Circuits</strong>: Circuits that include resistors, capacitors, and inductors. These circuits exhibit exponential and oscillatory behaviors and are rich topics for analysis in the time and frequency domains.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Practical Applications</h3>
<p>Electric circuits are used in countless applications, from simple household electrical systems to complex electronic devices. Understanding their principles is crucial for designing and troubleshooting electrical and electronic systems.</p>
