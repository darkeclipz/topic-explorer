# Thermochemistry
## Gibbs Free Energy

Gibbs Free Energy, often denoted as \( G \), is a thermodynamic quantity that helps predict whether a process or reaction will occur spontaneously at constant pressure and temperature. It combines enthalpy (heat content) and entropy (degree of disorder) into a single value, providing a criterion for spontaneity.

### Fundamental Concept:
The Gibbs Free Energy change (\( \Delta G \)) for a process is defined as:
\[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \]

- \( \Delta H \): Change in enthalpy (heat absorbed or released)
- \( T \): Absolute temperature in Kelvin
- \( \Delta S \): Change in entropy

### Criteria for Spontaneity:
- **\( \Delta G < 0 \)**: The process is spontaneous, meaning it can occur without external input.
- **\( \Delta G > 0 \)**: The process is non-spontaneous, requiring energy input to occur.
- **\( \Delta G = 0 \)**: The system is at equilibrium, and no net change occurs.

### Understanding the Components:
1. **Enthalpy (\( \Delta H \))**:
   - Represents the total heat content or heat change at constant pressure.
   - \( \Delta H < 0 \): Exothermic reaction, releases heat.
   - \( \Delta H > 0 \): Endothermic reaction, absorbs heat.

2. **Entropy (\( \Delta S \))**:
   - Represents the disorder or randomness of the system.
   - \( \Delta S < 0 \): Decrease in disorder.
   - \( \Delta S > 0 \): Increase in disorder.

3. **Temperature (T)**:
   - A factor that influences the impact of entropy on Gibbs Free Energy.
   - Higher temperatures amplify the influence of entropy on \( \Delta G \).

### Example Application:
Consider the reaction:

\[ \text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g) \]

1. **Calculate \( \Delta H \)** (from standard enthalpies of formation):
   - \( \Delta H \) values are typically provided in tables.
   
2. **Calculate \( \Delta S \)** (from standard entropies):
   - Similarly, entropy values are available in reference tables.

3. **Use the Gibbs Free Energy equation**:
   - At a specific temperature (e.g., 298 K), substitute the values into:
     \[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \]

### Significance in Chemistry:
- **Reaction Feasibility**: Gibbs Free Energy helps chemists determine which reactions are feasible under given conditions.
- **Equilibrium States**: It indicates the direction of spontaneous change and predicts the conditions for equilibrium.
- **Biochemical Processes**: In biochemistry, \( \Delta G \) explains the energetics behind metabolic reactions and cellular functions.

By assessing \( \Delta G \), scientists and engineers can design and optimize chemical processes, making Gibbs Free Energy a crucial concept in thermochemistry.
