# Atomic Structure
## Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and the smallest units that retain the properties of an element. Here's a detailed breakdown of atomic structure:

### Key Components of an Atom:
1. **Nucleus**: 
    - **Protons**: Positively charged particles found in the nucleus. The number of protons defines the atomic number and the type of element.
    - **Neutrons**: Neutral particles also located in the nucleus. They contribute to the atomic mass but do not affect the chemical properties of an element.

2. **Electrons**: 
    - Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in electron shells or energy levels. Electrons determine the reactivity and chemical bonding characteristics of an element.

### Atomic Number and Mass Number:
- **Atomic Number (Z)**: The number of protons in an atom's nucleus. It uniquely identifies an element.
- **Mass Number (A)**: The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. 

### Isotopes:
- **Definition**: Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same number of protons) that have different numbers of neutrons.
- **Example**: Carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and Carbon-14 (6 protons, 8 neutrons) are both isotopes of carbon.

### Electron Configuration:
- Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus.
- **Shells**: The electron shells are designated by the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and can hold a limited number of electrons according to the 2n² rule.
- **Subshells and Orbitals**: Each shell contains subshells (s, p, d, f) which have specific shapes and capacities for electrons. For instance, the s-subshell holds 2 electrons, the p-subshell holds 6 electrons, and so forth.
- **Electron Configuration Notation**: Represents the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus (e.g., 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ for Neon).

### Atomic Orbitals:
- **Shapes and Types**: Orbitals are regions within an atom where electrons are likely to be found. They have different shapes (s - spherical, p - dumbbell-shaped, d, f - more complex shapes).
- **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.
- **Hund's Rule**: Electrons will fill degenerate orbitals (orbitals of the same energy) singly before pairing up.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Valence Electrons**: Electrons in the outermost shell which determine an atom’s chemical properties and its ability to bond with other atoms.
2. **Ionization Energy**: The energy required to remove an electron from an atom.
3. **Atomic Radius**: The distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron.
4. **Electron Affinity**: The energy change that occurs when an atom gains an electron.

Understanding atomic structure is foundational to grasping more complex concepts in chemistry, such as periodic trends, chemical bonding, and reactivity.
