# Redox Reactions
## Electrochemical Cells

Electrochemical cells are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy (and vice versa) through redox reactions. In these reactions, electrons are transferred between chemical species, resulting in oxidation (loss of electrons) and reduction (gain of electrons). There are two main types of electrochemical cells: galvanic (or voltaic) cells and electrolytic cells.

### Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells
These cells generate electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions. They consist of two half-cells connected by a salt bridge. Each half-cell contains an electrode and an electrolyte solution. A typical galvanic cell setup includes:

- **Anode:** The electrode where oxidation occurs. This is the negative electrode in a galvanic cell.
- **Cathode:** The electrode where reduction occurs. This is the positive electrode in a galvanic cell.
- **Salt Bridge:** A device, often a tube filled with an electrolyte, that allows ions to flow between the two half-cells, maintaining electrical neutrality.
- **External Circuit:** A wire that connects the anode to the cathode, allowing electrons to flow from the anode to the cathode.

**Example:** The Daniell Cell, consisting of a zinc anode (Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻) and a copper cathode (Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu).

### Electrolytic Cells
These cells use electrical energy from an external power source to drive non-spontaneous redox reactions. They have applications in electroplating, electrolysis of water, and metal extraction.

- **Anode:** The electrode where oxidation occurs. This is the positive electrode in an electrolytic cell.
- **Cathode:** The electrode where reduction occurs. This is the negative electrode in an electrolytic cell.
- **Power Source:** An external power supply that provides the necessary energy to drive the non-spontaneous reaction.

**Example:** The electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases (2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂).

### Key Concepts:
1. **Cell Potential (Electromotive Force, EMF):** The voltage difference between the anode and cathode. For galvanic cells, it's calculated as \( E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}} \).
2. **Standard Electrode Potential:** The potential of a half-cell under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, 25°C). Positive values indicate a greater tendency to be reduced.
3. **Nernst Equation:** Used to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions.
4. **Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis:** Quantitative relationships that describe how the amount of substance produced at each electrode is proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the cell.

By understanding these principles, electrochemical cells can be utilized effectively in various applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors.
