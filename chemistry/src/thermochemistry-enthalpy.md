# Thermochemistry
## Enthalpy

Enthalpy (\(H\)) is a fundamental concept in thermochemistry, which is the study of heat changes in chemical reactions. It represents the total heat content of a system and is often used to describe heat transfer in chemical processes occurring at constant pressure.

### Key Points about Enthalpy:

1. **Definition**: 
    - Enthalpy is defined as the sum of the internal energy (\(U\)) of a system plus the product of pressure (\(P\)) and volume (\(V\)). Mathematically:
      \[
      H = U + PV
      \]

2. **Change in Enthalpy (\(\Delta H\))**:
    - The change in enthalpy during a process is given by:
      \[
      \Delta H = H_{\text{final}} - H_{\text{initial}}
      \]
    - For reactions occurring at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy equals the heat (\(q_p\)) absorbed or released by the system:
      \[
      \Delta H = q_p
      \]

3. **Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions**:
    - **Endothermic Reactions**: These reactions absorb heat from the surroundings, making the surroundings cooler. In such reactions, \(\Delta H\) is positive.
    - **Exothermic Reactions**: These reactions release heat into the surroundings, making the surroundings warmer. In such reactions, \(\Delta H\) is negative.

4. **Enthalpy Diagrams**: 
    - These are graphical representations of the enthalpy changes in a reaction. They show the relative enthalpies of reactants and products, indicating whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.

5. **Standard Enthalpy Changes**:
    - **Standard Enthalpy of Formation (\(\Delta H_f^\circ\))**: The change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.
    - **Standard Enthalpy of Combustion (\(\Delta H_c^\circ\))**: The change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is completely burnt in oxygen under standard conditions.
    - **Standard Enthalpy of Reaction (\(\Delta H_r^\circ\))**: The enthalpy change for a reaction carried out under standard conditions.

6. **Hess's Law**:
    - Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps in which the reaction occurs. This allows calculation of \(\Delta H\) for a reaction by summing enthalpy changes of individual steps:
      \[
      \Delta H_{\text{overall}} = \sum \Delta H_{\text{steps}}
      \]

7. **Calorimetry**:
    - In practical applications, enthalpy changes are often measured using calorimeters. These devices determine heat changes by measuring temperature changes in the surroundings.

8. **Applications**:
    - Enthalpy changes are crucial in various applications, including chemical engineering, thermodynamics, and biological processes. They help in understanding bond energies, reaction spontaneity, and the energy required or released in physical and chemical transformations.

### Example Calculation:
Consider the combustion of methane (\(\text{CH}_4\)):
\[
\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

Given the standard enthalpies of formation:
- \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4(g)) = -74.8 \ \text{kJ/mol}\)
- \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2(g)) = -393.5 \ \text{kJ/mol}\)
- \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)) = -285.8 \ \text{kJ/mol}\)
- \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{O}_2(g)) = 0\ \text{kJ/mol}\)

The standard enthalpy change of the reaction (\(\Delta H_r^\circ\)) can be calculated as:
\[
\Delta H_r^\circ = \left[ \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) + 2\cdot\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}) \right] - \left[ \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4) + 2\cdot\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{O}_2) \right]
\]
\[
\Delta H_r^\circ = \left[ -393.5 + 2(-285.8) \right] - \left[ -74.8 + 2(0) \right]
\]
\[
\Delta H_r^\circ = \left[ -393.5 - 571.6 \right] - [ -74.8 ]
\]
\[
\Delta H_r^\circ = -965.1 + 74.8
\]
\[
\Delta H_r^\circ = -890.3 \ \text{kJ/mol}
\]

The negative sign indicates the reaction is exothermic, releasing 890.3 kJ of energy per mole of methane combusted.

Understanding enthalpy and its changes is fundamental in predicting and analyzing the heat effects of chemical reactions, which is critical for many scientific and industrial processes.
