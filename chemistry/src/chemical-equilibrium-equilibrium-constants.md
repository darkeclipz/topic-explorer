# Chemical Equilibrium
## Equilibrium Constants

In chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium constant (K) is a key concept that quantifies the balance between the concentrations of reactants and products in a reversible chemical reaction at equilibrium. Here's a detailed explanation with related concepts:

### What is Chemical Equilibrium?
Chemical equilibrium occurs when a reversible chemical reaction reaches a state where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At this point, the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, although they are not necessarily equal.

### Types of Equilibrium Constants
There are two principal types of equilibrium constants:
1. **Kc (Concentration Equilibrium Constant)**: Defined in terms of molar concentrations of reactants and products.
2. **Kp (Pressure Equilibrium Constant)**: Used for reactions involving gases, defined in terms of partial pressures.

### General Expression for Kc
For a general reaction:
\[ aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD \]

The equilibrium constant expression in terms of concentration (Kc) is given by:
\[ K_c = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b} \]

- Square brackets [ ] denote the molar concentration of a species.
- The exponents (a, b, c, and d) are the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equation.

### General Expression for Kp
For reactions involving gases, the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures (Kp) is given by:
\[ K_p = \frac{(P_C)^c (P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a (P_B)^b} \]

- \( P \) denotes the partial pressure of a gas.

### Relationship Between Kc and Kp
For gas-phase reactions, Kc and Kp are related by the equation:
\[ K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n} \]

- \( R \) is the gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol)).
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.
- \( \Delta n \) is the change in moles of gas, given by \( \Delta n = (c + d) - (a + b) \).

### Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Equilibria
- **Homogeneous Equilibria**: All reactants and products are in the same phase (e.g., all gases or all aqueous solutions).
- **Heterogeneous Equilibria**: Reactants and products are in different phases (e.g., solid and gas).

For heterogeneous equilibria, the concentrations of pure solids and liquids are constant and omitted from the equilibrium expression.

### Magnitude of K and Reaction Extent
- **K >> 1**: The reaction favors the formation of products.
- **K << 1**: The reaction favors the formation of reactants.
- **K ≈ 1**: Neither reactants nor products are significantly favored; the system has comparable amounts of both.

### Application Examples
1. **Synthesis of Ammonia (Haber Process)**:
   \[ N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g) \]
   The equilibrium constant expression is:
   \[ K_c = \frac{[NH_3]^2}{[N_2][H_2]^3} \]

2. **Decomposition of Calcium Carbonate**:
   \[ CaCO_3(s) \rightleftharpoons CaO(s) + CO_2(g) \]
   The equilibrium constant expression for this heterogeneous equilibrium is:
   \[ K_p = P_{CO_2} \]

Understanding the equilibrium constant helps chemists predict the extent of a reaction, optimize conditions for desired outcomes, and calculate equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products.
