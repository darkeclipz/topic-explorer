# Stoichiometry
## Percent Yield

Percent yield is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It compares the actual yield obtained from the experiment to the theoretical yield calculated based on stoichiometry. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Steps to Calculate Percent Yield**

1. **Write and Balance the Chemical Equation:**
   Ensure the chemical equation for the reaction is balanced. This provides the necessary molar ratios between reactants and products.

2. **Determine the Theoretical Yield:**
   - **Identify the Limiting Reagent:** The limiting reagent is the reactant that will be completely consumed first, limiting the amount of product formed.
   - **Calculate the Theoretical Yield:** Using stoichiometry, calculate the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the limiting reagent. This is the theoretical yield.

3. **Measure the Actual Yield:**
   - The actual yield is the amount of product actually obtained from the reaction. This is typically measured experimentally.

4. **Calculate the Percent Yield:**
   Use the following formula to calculate the percent yield:
   
   \[
   \text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100
   \]

### **Example Calculation**

Imagine a simple reaction where 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of water:

\[
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O
\]

Suppose you start with 4 moles of \(H_2\) and 2 moles of \(O_2\), and the experiment results in 3 moles of water.

1. **Balanced Equation:**
   
   The equation is already balanced.

2. **Determine the Theoretical Yield:**
   
   - **Identify the Limiting Reagent:** From the balanced equation, the molar ratio of \(H_2\) to \(O_2\) is 2:1. For 4 moles of \(H_2\):
   
     \[
     4 \text{ moles } H_2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mole } O_2}{2 \text{ moles } H_2} = 2 \text{ moles } O_2
     \]
     
     Both \(H_2\) and \(O_2\) are in the correct stoichiometric ratio, so no limiting reagent appears clear without extra information. Usually, based on the assumption, determine that one starting material could be completely used.
     
   - **Calculate the Theoretical Yield:** Assuming no limiting reagent is a hot condition:
     
     Starting 4 moles \(H_2\) corresponds to:
     
     \[
     4 \text{ moles } H_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ moles } H_2O}{2 \text{ moles } H_2} = 4 \text{ moles } H_2O
     \]
   
3. **Measure the Actual Yield:**
   
   The actual yield obtained in the experiment is 3 moles of \(H_2O\).

4. **Calculate the Percent Yield:**

   \[
   \text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{3 \text{ moles } H_2O}{4 \text{ moles } H_2O} \right) \times 100 = 75\%
   \]

### **Importance of Percent Yield**

- **Efficiency Assessment:** Helps in evaluating the efficiency and practicality of a reaction.
- **Economic Analysis:** Important for industrial processes to estimate costs and resource management.
- **Reaction Insight:** Indicates potential issues in the experimental setup or reaction conditions.

Understanding percent yield is crucial in both academic and industrial chemistry for optimizing and validating experimental results.
