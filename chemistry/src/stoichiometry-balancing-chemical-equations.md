# Stoichiometry
## Balancing Chemical Equations

Balancing chemical equations is a fundamental concept in stoichiometry that ensures the law of conservation of mass is obeyed. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; thus, the same number of each type of atom must appear on both the reactant and product sides of the equation.

### Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations:

1. **Write the Unbalanced Equation:**
   Start by writing the correct reactants and products of the chemical reaction with their respective formulas. For example:
   \[
   \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]

2. **Count the Atoms of Each Element:**
   Count the number of atoms of each element in both reactants and products. Initially, for the reaction above:
   - Reactants: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms.
   - Products: 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom.

3. **Identify Imbalances:**
   Identify which elements are not balanced. In the given example, hydrogen is balanced but oxygen is not.

4. **Use Coefficients to Balance Atoms:**
   Adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of the chemical formulas) to balance the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation. Coefficients should be the smallest set of whole numbers possible.
   - To balance oxygen, we need 2 oxygen atoms on the product side:
     \[
     \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
     \]
   - Now we count the atoms again:
     - Reactants: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms.
     - Products: 4 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms.
   - Hydrogen is now unbalanced. Adjust the coefficient for H₂ to balance it:
     \[
     2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
     \]
   - Verify everything is balanced:
     - Reactants: 4 hydrogen atoms (2 molecules of H₂), 2 oxygen atoms (1 molecule of O₂).
     - Products: 4 hydrogen atoms (2 molecules of H₂O), 2 oxygen atoms (2 molecules of H₂O).

5. **Double-Check All Atoms and Coefficients:**
   Confirm that every type of atom is balanced on both sides of the equation, and ensure coefficients are in the simplest whole-number ratio.

### Example:
Consider balancing the equation for the combustion of propane (C₃H₈):
\[
\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
1. **Write the unbalanced equation:** 
   \[
   \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]

2. **Count the atoms:**
   \[
   \text{Reactants:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 2 \text{O}
   \,\text{Products:} \, 1 \text{C}, 2 \text{H}, 3 \text{O}
   \]

3. **Balance carbon:** 
   \[
   \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Reactants:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 2 \text{O}
   \,\text{Products:} \, 3 \text{C}, 2 \text{H}, 7 \text{O}
   \]

4. **Balance hydrogen:**
   \[
   \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Reactants:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 2 \text{O}
   \,\text{Products:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 10 \text{O}
   \]

5. **Balance oxygen:**
   \[
   \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Reactants:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 10 \text{O}
   \,\text{Products:} \, 3 \text{C}, 8 \text{H}, 10 \text{O}
   \]
   
6. **Double-check:**
   Every element is balanced. Thus, the balanced equation is:
   \[
   \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]

### Summary:
Balancing chemical equations involves ensuring each element has the same number of atoms on both sides by adjusting coefficients, not the subscripts in the formulas. This method guarantees the conservation of mass and reflects the actual chemical stoichiometric relationships in reactions.
