# Atomic Structure
## Isotopes

Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Because they have the same number of protons, isotopes of an element share the same atomic number but have different mass numbers.

### Key Features of Isotopes:

1. **Atomic Number (Z):**
   - The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which determines the element's identity.
   - Isotopes of an element have the same atomic number.

2. **Mass Number (A):**
   - The mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
   - Isotopes have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons.

3. **Chemical Properties:**
   - Isotopes of an element typically exhibit nearly identical chemical behavior because chemical properties are primarily determined by the electron configuration, which depends on the number of protons.

4. **Physical Properties:**
   - Isotopes may have different physical properties (e.g., density, melting point) due to their different masses.

### Examples of Isotopes:

1. **Hydrogen Isotopes:**
   - **Protium (¹H):** The most common isotope, with 1 proton and 0 neutrons.
   - **Deuterium (²H or D):** Has 1 proton and 1 neutron.
   - **Tritium (³H or T):** Has 1 proton and 2 neutrons.

2. **Carbon Isotopes:**
   - **Carbon-12 (¹²C):** The most stable and abundant isotope, with 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
   - **Carbon-13 (¹³C):** Contains 6 protons and 7 neutrons.
   - **Carbon-14 (¹⁴C):** A radioactive isotope with 6 protons and 8 neutrons, used in radiocarbon dating.

### Applications of Isotopes:

1. **Medical Uses:**
   - Radioisotopes are used in medical diagnostics and treatments, such as in PET scans and cancer radiotherapy.

2. **Archaeological Dating:**
   - Carbon-14 dating is utilized to determine the age of archaeological artifacts.

3. **Research and Industry:**
   - Isotopes are used as tracers in biochemical and chemical research, as well as in industrial applications like material analysis.

### Notation:

- Isotopes are commonly represented in the format \(_Z^A\text{Element Symbol}\), where \(Z\) is the atomic number and \(A\) is the mass number.
  - For example, Carbon-14 is written as \(^{14}_6\text{C}\).

Understanding isotopes is crucial in fields ranging from chemistry and physics to biology and environmental science, as they provide insights into elemental behavior, radioactive decay processes, and much more.
