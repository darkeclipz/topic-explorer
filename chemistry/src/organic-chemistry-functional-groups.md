## Functional Groups

Functional groups are specific groups of atoms within molecules that have characteristic properties and chemical reactivity. They play a crucial role in determining the behavior of organic molecules in chemical reactions. Here are some common functional groups along with a brief description:

1. **Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**
   - Found in: Alcohols (e.g., ethanol)
   - Properties: Polar, capable of forming hydrogen bonds, increases solubility in water.

2. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**
   - Found in: Aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde) and ketones (e.g., acetone)
   - Properties: Polar, reactive center for nucleophilic addition reactions.
     - Aldehydes have the carbonyl group at the end of a carbon chain.
     - Ketones have the carbonyl group within the carbon chain.

3. **Carboxyl Group (-COOH)**
   - Found in: Carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid)
   - Properties: Acidic, can donate a hydrogen ion (proton), polar, participates in hydrogen bonding.

4. **Amino Group (-NH2)**
   - Found in: Amines (e.g., methylamine)
   - Properties: Basic, can accept a hydrogen ion (proton), polar, interacts with acids through hydrogen bonding.

5. **Sulfhydryl Group (-SH)**
   - Found in: Thiols (e.g., cysteine)
   - Properties: Similar to hydroxyl but less polar, can form disulfide bonds, important for protein structure.

6. **Phosphate Group (-PO4)**
   - Found in: Organic phosphates (e.g., ATP)
   - Properties: Highly polar, can release or accept protons (acid-base characteristics), involved in energy transfer.

7. **Methyl Group (-CH3)**
   - Found in: Various organic molecules
   - Properties: Nonpolar, hydrophobic, can affect molecule's size and shape, often modifies activity of biomolecules when attached.

8. **Phenyl Group (C6H5)**
   - Found in: Aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene)
   - Properties: Stable, planar, contributes to aromaticity, can participate in π-π interactions.

9. **Ether Group (R-O-R')**
   - Found in: Ethers (e.g., diethyl ether)
   - Properties: Relatively nonpolar, used as solvents due to their low reactivity.

10. **Ester Group (R-COO-R')**
    - Found in: Esters (e.g., ethyl acetate)
    - Properties: Formed from the reaction of carboxylic acids and alcohols, often have fruity smells, used in fragrances and flavors.

Understanding the behavior and reactivity of functional groups is fundamental in organic chemistry, as they dictate how molecules interact with each other and engage in chemical reactions.
