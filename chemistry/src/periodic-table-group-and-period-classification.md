# Periodic Table
## Group and Period Classification

The periodic table is a comprehensive chart that organizes all known chemical elements based on their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. The classification into groups and periods provides a systematic way to predict the properties of elements and their compounds.

### Groups:

- **Vertical Columns**: The periodic table is divided into 18 vertical columns known as groups or families.
- **Group Numbering**: Groups are typically numbered 1 to 18 from left to right. Alternatively, in North America and old IUPAC systems, groups were labeled in a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., 1A, 2A, up to 8A for main-group elements and 1B to 8B for transition elements).
- **Similar Chemical Properties**: Elements within the same group share similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons. For example, Group 1 elements (alkali metals) all have one valence electron and highly reactive metals.
- **Group Names**:
  - **Group 1**: Alkali metals (excluding Hydrogen)
  - **Group 2**: Alkaline earth metals
  - **Groups 3-12**: Transition metals
  - **Group 13**: Boron group
  - **Group 14**: Carbon group
  - **Group 15**: Nitrogen group
  - **Group 16**: Oxygen group (Chalcogens)
  - **Group 17**: Halogens
  - **Group 18**: Noble gases

### Periods:

- **Horizontal Rows**: The periodic table is divided into seven horizontal rows known as periods.
- **Period Numbering**: Periods are numbered from 1 to 7 from top to bottom.
- **Electron Shells**: Each period corresponds to the number of electron shells an atom of that element has. For example:
  - **Period 1 elements (Hydrogen, Helium)**: 1 electron shell
  - **Period 2 elements (Lithium to Neon)**: 2 electron shells
  - **Period 3 elements (Sodium to Argon)**: 3 electron shells
- **Properties Varied Along Period**: Unlike groups, the chemical properties of elements change significantly across a period because the number of valence electrons increases incrementally from left to right, affecting reactivity and bonding behavior. For instance, moving from left to right across Period 3, you progress from metals like sodium (Na) through metalloids like silicon (Si) to nonmetals like chlorine (Cl).

### Key Concepts:

- **Valence Electrons**: Electrons in the outermost shell, governing an element's chemical behavior.
- **Atomic Radius**: Generally decreases across a period (left to right) due to increasing nuclear charge and increases down a group due to the addition of electron shells.
- **Ionization Energy**: The energy required to remove an electron from an atom, which generally increases across a period and decreases down a group.
- **Electronegativity**: The tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond, which usually increases across a period and decreases down a group.

Understanding groups and periods allows chemists to deduce reactivity, bonding characteristics, and other essential chemical properties of elements, facilitating the study and application of chemistry in various fields.
