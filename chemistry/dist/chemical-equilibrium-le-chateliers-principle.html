<h1>Chemical Equilibrium</h1>
<h2>Le Chatelier's Principle</h2>
<p>Le Chatelier's Principle is a fundamental concept in chemical equilibrium that predicts how a system at equilibrium will respond to a disturbance or change in conditions. Named after the French chemist Henri Louis Le Chatelier, this principle can be stated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Le Chatelier's Principle:</strong> If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions (such as concentration, temperature, or pressure), the system will respond by shifting the position of the equilibrium to counteract the disturbance and restore a new equilibrium state.</p>
<p>Here's a detailed explanation of how this principle works with different types of disturbances:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Change in Concentration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the concentration of a reactant or product is changed, the equilibrium will shift to minimize that change.</li>
<li>For example, consider the equilibrium:
[ \text{A} + \text{B} \rightleftharpoons \text{C} + \text{D} ]</li>
<li>If the concentration of reactant A is increased, the system will shift to the right to produce more products (C and D) and reduce the concentration of A.</li>
<li>Conversely, if the concentration of product C is increased, the system will shift to the left to produce more reactants (A and B) to consume the excess C.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Change in Temperature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For exothermic reactions (releasing heat), increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left (towards the reactants) as the system attempts to absorb the excess heat.</li>
<li>For endothermic reactions (absorbing heat), increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the right (towards the products) to absorb the added heat.</li>
<li>For example:
[ \text{A} + \text{B} \rightleftharpoons \text{C} + \text{D} + \text{heat} ]</li>
<li>Increasing the temperature will favor the reverse reaction (toward reactants) to absorb the heat, while decreasing the temperature will favor the forward reaction (toward products).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Change in Pressure (for Gaseous Systems):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the pressure will affect equilibria involving gases. An increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium towards the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce pressure.</li>
<li>Conversely, a decrease in pressure will shift the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas.</li>
<li>For example:
[ \text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g) ]</li>
<li>Increasing pressure shifts the equilibrium to the right (toward the production of fewer gas molecules, NH₃), and decreasing pressure shifts it to the left (toward the reactants, N₂ and H₂).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By applying Le Chatelier's Principle, chemists can predict how changes in external conditions will affect the position of equilibrium in a chemical reaction. This principle is especially useful in industrial processes where optimizing product yields is essential.</p>
