# Data Structures
## Trees

Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to represent hierarchical relationships. Here are some key points to understand about trees:

### Basic Concepts

1. **Node**: Each point in a tree is called a node. It contains the data and links to its children.
2. **Root**: The topmost node of a tree. It doesn't have any parent.
3. **Parent and Child**: If a node directly connects to another node below it, the upper node is called the parent, and the lower node is known as the child.
4. **Leaf**: A node with no children.
5. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent.
6. **Edge**: The connection between a parent and a child.
7. **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
8. **Level**: The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.
9. **Height**: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf.
10. **Subtree**: A subtree is a portion of a tree that includes a node and all its descendants.

### Types of Trees

1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where for each node, all elements in the left subtree are less, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.
3. **Balanced Tree**: A tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. E.g., AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.
4. **N-ary Tree**: A generalization of a binary tree where each node can have up to 'N' children.
5. **Trie**: A tree used for storing a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. Often used in autocomplete features.
6. **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. E.g., Min-Heap, Max-Heap.
7. **B-tree**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Commonly used in databases and filesystems.

### Common Operations

1. **Traversal**:
    - **In-Order**: Left, Root, Right (commonly used in BSTs to retrieve sorted data)
    - **Pre-Order**: Root, Left, Right (useful for copying the tree)
    - **Post-Order**: Left, Right, Root (useful for deleting the tree)
    - **Level-Order (Breadth-First)**: Traversing nodes level by level.

2. **Insertion**: Adding a node to a tree while maintaining the tree's properties.
3. **Deletion**: Removing a node from a tree and reorganizing it to maintain properties.
4. **Searching**: Finding a node in the tree.
5. **Balancing**: Ensuring the tree remains balanced to maintain efficient operations (specific to AVL, Red-Black Trees).

### Applications

- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Filesystems, organizational structures.
- **Searching**: Quick lookup, insertion, and deletion (Binary Search Trees).
- **Prefix Searches**: Auto-completion and spell checking (Tries).
- **Networking**: Representing network topologies.
- **Game Development**: AI, decision-making trees.
- **Balancing Loads**: In databases for indexing (B-trees).

Overall, understanding trees is crucial for efficient data manipulation, storage, and retrieval in various computer applications.
