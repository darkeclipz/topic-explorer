# GLSL Basics
## Overview of GLSL

GLSL, or OpenGL Shading Language, is a C-like programming language designed specifically for writing shaders, which are programs that run on the GPU. Here's an overview of GLSL:

### Overview of GLSL

**1. Purpose of GLSL:**
   - GLSL is used for writing both vertex and fragment shaders, which are essential for rendering graphics on the GPU. 
   - It allows for the implementation of complex visual effects by providing more control over the graphics pipeline.

**2. Types of Shaders:**
   - **Vertex Shaders**: These process each vertex's attributes (position, color, texture coordinates) and are responsible for transforming vertex positions from object space to screen space.
   - **Fragment Shaders**: These calculate the color and other attributes of each pixel. They determine the final color of a pixel based on textures, lighting, and other factors.

**3. Shader Pipeline:**
   - The graphics pipeline consists of several stages, where shaders are executed at specific points:
     - **Vertex Shader Stage**: Processes vertices to transform vertex data.
     - **Fragment Shader Stage**: Computes pixel colors.
     - Other stages include Geometry Shaders, Tessellation Shaders, etc., which are used for more advanced rendering techniques.
  
**4. Writing GLSL Code:**
   - GLSL code follows a C-like syntax, making it familiar to many programmers.
   - It includes data types such as float, int, vec2, vec3, vec4 (for vectors), and mat2, mat3, mat4 (for matrices).
   - Common operations in GLSL include matrix transformations, texture sampling, and blending.
  
**5. Compilation and Linking:**
   - GLSL shaders are compiled and linked at runtime. Each shader type is compiled individually into a shader object.
   - Compiled shaders are then linked into a shader program, which can be used to render objects in a scene.

**6. Built-in Variables and Functions:**
   - GLSL provides a range of built-in variables (e.g., `gl_Position` for vertex shaders) and functions (e.g., `texture()` for sampling textures).
   - These built-ins simplify common tasks and help interface with the OpenGL state.

**7. Uniforms, Attributes, and Varyings:**
   - **Uniforms**: Read-only variables that are set per frame and remain constant for all vertices and fragments during a draw call. Used for data that doesnâ€™t change per vertex/fragment (e.g., light positions, transformation matrices).
   - **Attributes**: Variables that provide per-vertex data to the vertex shader (e.g., vertex positions, normals).
   - **Varyings**: Variables that are interpolated between vertex and fragment shaders. Used to pass data from vertex shaders to fragment shaders (e.g., interpolated colors, texture coordinates).

**8. GLSL Versions and Extensions:**
   - GLSL has evolved over time with different versions, adding new features and improvements.
   - Each version corresponds to a specific OpenGL version, and using the correct version of GLSL is crucial for compatibility.
   - Extensions provide additional functionality that may not yet be standardized.

### Summary:
GLSL is a powerful tool for creating custom graphics shaders, offering fine control over the rendering process. Understanding the basics of GLSL, including its types of shaders, data types, compilation process, and built-in functionalities, is essential for anyone looking to delve into advanced graphics programming and rendering techniques.
