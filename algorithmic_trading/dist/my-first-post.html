    <h1>My first post</h1>
<h2>An example of using TinyBlog</h2>
<p>A post can start with a title, an author, and a date. The content of the post is written in Markdown.
If the header is omitted, the file name is used to generate the HTML file.</p>
<h2>What's included?</h2>
<p>All of the valid Markdown is converted into HTML, thanks to the <code>Markdig</code> package.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to add code snippets, and these are highlighted using the <code>highlight.js</code> package, such as the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You might have to add additional language support, or change the theme for <code>highlight.js</code> to work properly.</p>
<p>Finally, Mathjax has also been included. This allows for the rendering of mathematical equations, such as the following:</p>
<p>$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$</p>
<p>It is also possible to use inline math with the \$ sign. For example, $e^{i\pi} = -1$.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Because of this, a \$ sign has to be delimited with two backslashes. This first backslash for Markdown, and the second for Mathjax.</p>
<h2>Simplicity first</h2>
<p>The main motivation behind TinyBlog is to keep things simple. It is a single-file blog engine that is easy to understand and modify. It is not meant to be a full-fledged blog engine, but rather a starting point for you to create a simple blog without much of a hassle.</p>
<p>The generated HTML files are also very simple, and contain minimal CSS. This allows for easy customization, and the addition of your own CSS.</p>
