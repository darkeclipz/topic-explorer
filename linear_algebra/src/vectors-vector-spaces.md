## Vector Spaces

Vector spaces (also known as linear spaces) are fundamental structures in linear algebra, providing a framework for studying vectors, points, and more complex geometrical objects. Here’s an explanation of vector spaces along with key concepts:

### Definition of a Vector Space

A vector space \(V\) over a field \(F\) is a set composed of vectors with two operations—vector addition and scalar multiplication—that satisfy the following axioms:

#### Axioms:

1. **Closure under Addition:** For any two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) in \(V\), their sum \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\) is also in \(V\).
2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** For any vector \(\mathbf{u}\) in \(V\) and any scalar \(a\) in \(F\), the product \(a\mathbf{u}\) is also in \(V\).
3. **Associativity of Addition:** \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\) for all \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V\).
4. **Commutativity of Addition:** \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\) for all \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V\).
5. **Existence of Additive Identity:** There exists a vector \(\mathbf{0}\) in \(V\) such that \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}\) for all \(\mathbf{u} \in V\).
6. **Existence of Additive Inverses:** For every vector \(\mathbf{u} \in V\), there exists a vector \(-\mathbf{u}\) in \(V\) such that \(\mathbf{u} + (-\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{0}\).
7. **Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication:** \(a(b\mathbf{u}) = (ab)\mathbf{u}\) for all \(a, b \in F\) and \(\mathbf{u} \in V\).
8. **Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication:** \(1\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}\) for all \(\mathbf{u} \in V\), where \(1\) is the multiplicative identity in \(F\).
9. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition:** \(a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}\) for all \(a \in F\) and \(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V\).
10. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with Respect to Field Addition:** \((a + b)\mathbf{u} = a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{u}\) for all \(a, b \in F\) and \(\mathbf{u} \in V\).

### Key Concepts in Vector Spaces

1. **Basis and Dimension:**
   - A basis of a vector space \(V\) is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space. 
   - The dimension of \(V\) is the number of vectors in a basis for \(V\).

2. **Subspaces:**
   - A subspace of a vector space \(V\) is a subset of \(V\) that is itself a vector space under the same operations of addition and scalar multiplication.

3. **Linear Independence:**
   - A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. Otherwise, they are linearly dependent.

4. **Linear Transformations:**
   - A linear transformation (or linear map) between two vector spaces is a function that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.

### Examples of Vector Spaces

- **Euclidean Space \(\mathbb{R}^n\):** The set of all \(n\)-tuples of real numbers forms a vector space over the field of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\).
- **Polynomial Space \(P_n\):** The set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to \(n\) forms a vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\).
- **Function Space:** The set of all continuous functions on a given domain forms a vector space.

Understanding vector spaces enables the comprehension of various mathematical and practical applications, including solutions to systems of linear equations, transformations in geometry, and much more.
