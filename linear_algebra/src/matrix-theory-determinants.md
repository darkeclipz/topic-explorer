# Matrix Theory
## Determinants

Determinants are a fundamental concept in matrix theory with important applications in solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues, and more. Here's an overview of the key concepts related to determinants:

### Definition:
The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix. It is often denoted as det(A) or |A| for a matrix A.

### Properties of Determinants:
1. **Uniqueness**: The determinant is uniquely determined for a given square matrix.
2. **Determinant of Identity**: The determinant of the identity matrix is 1.
3. **Multiplicative Property**: For square matrices A and B, det(AB) = det(A) * det(B).
4. **Transpose Property**: For any square matrix A, det(A) = det(A^T).
5. **Effect of Row Operations**:
   - Swapping two rows changes the sign of the determinant.
   - Multiplying a row by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar.
   - Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant.

### Calculation of Determinants:
1. **2x2 Matrix**:
   For a 2x2 matrix A = [[a, b], [c, d]], the determinant is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{det}(A) = ad - bc
   \]

2. **3x3 Matrix**:
   For a 3x3 matrix A = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], the determinant is:
   \[
   \text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
   \]

3. **General nxn Matrix**:
   For larger matrices, determinants are often calculated using methods like:
   - **Laplace Expansion (Cofactor Expansion)**: Involves breaking the matrix into smaller matrices (minors) and calculating recursively.
   - **Row Reduction**: Using Gaussian elimination, transform the matrix into upper triangular form and then multiply the diagonal elements.

### Applications of Determinants:
1. **Solving Linear Systems**: Using Cramer's rule, determinants can solve systems of linear equations.
2. **Invertibility**: A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.
3. **Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - Î»I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

### Example:
For a 2x2 matrix A:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
1 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of A is:
\[
\text{det}(A) = (2 \cdot 4) - (3 \cdot 1) = 8 - 3 = 5
\]

Understanding determinants is crucial for many advanced topics in linear algebra and related fields.
