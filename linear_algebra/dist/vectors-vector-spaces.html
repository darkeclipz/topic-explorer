<h1>Vectors</h1>
<h2>Vector Spaces</h2>
<p>Vector spaces (also known as linear spaces) are fundamental structures in linear algebra, providing a framework for studying vectors, points, and more complex geometrical objects. Here’s an explanation of vector spaces along with key concepts:</p>
<h3>Definition of a Vector Space</h3>
<p>A vector space (V) over a field (F) is a set composed of vectors with two operations—vector addition and scalar multiplication—that satisfy the following axioms:</p>
<h4>Axioms:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Closure under Addition:</strong> For any two vectors (\mathbf{u}) and (\mathbf{v}) in (V), their sum (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) is also in (V).</li>
<li><strong>Closure under Scalar Multiplication:</strong> For any vector (\mathbf{u}) in (V) and any scalar (a) in (F), the product (a\mathbf{u}) is also in (V).</li>
<li><strong>Associativity of Addition:</strong> ((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})) for all (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V).</li>
<li><strong>Commutativity of Addition:</strong> (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}) for all (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V).</li>
<li><strong>Existence of Additive Identity:</strong> There exists a vector (\mathbf{0}) in (V) such that (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}) for all (\mathbf{u} \in V).</li>
<li><strong>Existence of Additive Inverses:</strong> For every vector (\mathbf{u} \in V), there exists a vector (-\mathbf{u}) in (V) such that (\mathbf{u} + (-\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{0}).</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication:</strong> (a(b\mathbf{u}) = (ab)\mathbf{u}) for all (a, b \in F) and (\mathbf{u} \in V).</li>
<li><strong>Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication:</strong> (1\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}) for all (\mathbf{u} \in V), where (1) is the multiplicative identity in (F).</li>
<li><strong>Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition:</strong> (a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}) for all (a \in F) and (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V).</li>
<li><strong>Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with Respect to Field Addition:</strong> ((a + b)\mathbf{u} = a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{u}) for all (a, b \in F) and (\mathbf{u} \in V).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Concepts in Vector Spaces</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Basis and Dimension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A basis of a vector space (V) is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space.</li>
<li>The dimension of (V) is the number of vectors in a basis for (V).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Subspaces:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A subspace of a vector space (V) is a subset of (V) that is itself a vector space under the same operations of addition and scalar multiplication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Independence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. Otherwise, they are linearly dependent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Transformations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A linear transformation (or linear map) between two vector spaces is a function that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Examples of Vector Spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Euclidean Space (\mathbb{R}^n):</strong> The set of all (n)-tuples of real numbers forms a vector space over the field of real numbers (\mathbb{R}).</li>
<li><strong>Polynomial Space (P_n):</strong> The set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to (n) forms a vector space over (\mathbb{R}) or (\mathbb{C}).</li>
<li><strong>Function Space:</strong> The set of all continuous functions on a given domain forms a vector space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding vector spaces enables the comprehension of various mathematical and practical applications, including solutions to systems of linear equations, transformations in geometry, and much more.</p>
