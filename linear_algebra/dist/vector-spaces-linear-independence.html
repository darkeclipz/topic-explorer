<h1>Vector Spaces</h1>
<h2>Linear Independence</h2>
<p>Linear independence is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, particularly within the context of vector spaces. It refers to a set of vectors that are not linearly dependent on each other. Here's a detailed explanation:</p>
<h3>Definition:</h3>
<p>A set of vectors ({v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n}) in a vector space (V) is said to be <strong>linearly independent</strong> if the only solution to the equation</p>
<p>[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0 ]</p>
<p>is (c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0), where (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n) are scalars (constants).</p>
<p>Conversely, if there exists a non-trivial solution (at least one (c_i \neq 0)) to this equation, then the vectors are said to be <strong>linearly dependent</strong>.</p>
<h3>Geometry Intuition:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In (\mathbb{R}^2) (2-dimensional space), two vectors are linearly independent if they do not lie on the same line through the origin. For example, the vectors (\begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 0 \end{pmatrix}) and (\begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 1 \end{pmatrix}) are linearly independent.</li>
<li>In (\mathbb{R}^3) (3-dimensional space), three vectors are linearly independent if they do not lie in the same plane through the origin. For example, the vectors (\begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 0 \ 0 \end{pmatrix}), (\begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 1 \ 0 \end{pmatrix}), and (\begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 0 \ 1 \end{pmatrix}) are linearly independent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why It's Important:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis:</strong> A basis for a vector space (V) is a maximal linearly independent set of vectors in (V). This is crucial because a basis provides a way to uniquely represent every vector in the space as a linear combination of basis vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Dimension:</strong> The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in a basis for that space. For example, (\mathbb{R}^3) has dimension 3, meaning any basis of (\mathbb{R}^3) will consist of exactly three linearly independent vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Span:</strong> The span of a set of vectors is the collection of all linear combinations of those vectors. If the vectors are linearly independent, they span the vector space without redundancy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Consider the vectors (\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 2 \ 3 \end{pmatrix}) and (\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \ 5 \ 6 \end{pmatrix}) in (\mathbb{R}^3).</p>
<p>To determine if they are linearly independent, set up the equation:
[ c_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 2 \ 3 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \ 5 \ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 0 \ 0 \end{pmatrix} ]</p>
<p>This gives us the system of equations:
[ c_1 + 4c_2 = 0 ]
[ 2c_1 + 5c_2 = 0 ]
[ 3c_1 + 6c_2 = 0 ]</p>
<p>Solving this system, we find (c_1 = 0) and (c_2 = 0), indicating that the vectors are linearly independent.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Understanding linear independence is crucial for many applications in linear algebra, including solving systems of linear equations, transforming matrices, and more advanced topics like eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It serves as a foundation for building and working with vector spaces.</p>
