# Security
## Authorization

Authorization is a key concept in the field of information security and access control. It determines what an authenticated user is or isn’t allowed to do within a system. While authentication verifies the identity of a user or system, authorization verifies their permissions.

### Key Concepts in Authorization:

1. **Roles and Permissions:**
   - **Roles:** Roles are assigned to users based on job responsibilities or functions. For example, roles like 'admin,' 'editor,' and 'viewer' might be created to group similar levels of access.
   - **Permissions:** Permissions are specific rights or privileges assigned to roles or directly to users. For example, 'read,' 'write,' 'delete,' and 'execute' permissions specify the level of access.

2. **Access Control Models:**
   - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** In this model, the data owner decides who gets access to specific resources. It's flexible but less secure.
   - **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** Access rights are regulated by a central authority based on multiple classifications (e.g., top secret, secret). This model is more rigid and secure.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access permissions are assigned to predefined roles rather than individual users. Users are then assigned roles, making this method scalable and easier to manage.
   - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** This model considers various attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, environment conditions) to make access decisions.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   - This principle states that users should be given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform their job functions. It reduces the risk of accidental misuse or malicious exploitation of system permissions.

4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - ACLs are used to define what actions (read, write, execute) users or system processes can perform on a given resource. Each resource will have an ACL associated with it, specifying which users or system entities can act upon it and in what way.

5. **Policy-Based Management:**
   - Policies are sets of rules that govern who can access what resources under which conditions. Policies can be organization-wide or specific to certain departments, applications, or data types.

6. **OAuth and Token-Based Authorization:**
   - OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing credentials. Token-based authorization (like JWT - JSON Web Token) is often used in APIs and web services for this purpose.

7. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - For better security and regulatory compliance, it’s important to log access attempts and activities. Auditing helps in tracking unauthorized access attempts and understanding security breaches.

### Best Practices for Authorization:

- **Regularly review and update access controls:** Ensure permissions are up to date and still relevant.
- **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adds an additional layer of security beyond just passwords.
- **Conduct periodic access reviews and audits:** Helps in identifying and removing unnecessary permissions.
- **Educate employees about security policies:** Awareness can prevent many security issues related to misuse of permissions.
- **Use encryption:** Protect data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.

Understanding these concepts and best practices ensures that systems are securely managing who has access to what, reducing the risks associated with unauthorized access.
